## Core Fields
- Title: Tree of Thoughts Meets Hugging Face Agents: A Survey of Tree of Thoughts and Hugging Face Agent Frameworks
- Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain predominantly linear in inference-time reasoning, which limits exploration, backtracking, and deliberate evaluation on complex multi-step tasks. In parallel, agent frameworks have improved tool interaction and action execution, but often exhibit planning and recovery weaknesses under non-trivial reasoning loads. This survey synthesizes Tree of Thoughts (ToT) reasoning methods and the Hugging Face agent ecosystem, focusing on technical mechanisms, integration patterns, and evidence boundaries. We review ToT generation-evaluation-search loops, summarize benchmark evidence reported in prior work, and map implementation affordances in Hugging Face agent frameworks (including smolagents and related tooling). We also document methodological requirements for reproducible ToT-agent claims, including study selection transparency, extraction schema, claim-evidence mapping, and explicit labeling of runnable versus illustrative examples. The manuscript emphasizes conservative, source-attributed interpretation and separates prior empirical findings from architectural walkthroughs and pseudo-code. The result is a systematic technical reference for researchers and practitioners evaluating structured-reasoning agent designs, with explicit discussion of expected gains, trade-offs (including cost and latency), and open gaps for future controlled evaluation.
