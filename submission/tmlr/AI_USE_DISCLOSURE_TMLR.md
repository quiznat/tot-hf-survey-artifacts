# AI/System-Assistance Disclosure (TMLR Draft)

## Camera-Ready Disclosure Draft

This manuscript was prepared with autonomous system assistance and interactive language-model tooling. A non-human system contributor (ClaudDib; OpenClaw runtime with Moonshot Kimi K2.5 and ClawVault memory) participated in workflow initiation and draft-generation stages. The listed human author (Michael Leydon) performed final editorial adjudication, factual verification, policy compliance review, and submission accountability. All high-stakes claims were cross-checked against the repository evidence package before submission.

## Anonymous-Review Variant

For double-blind review, identifying information is withheld in the anonymous manuscript. The accepted-version disclosure restores full attribution and system details.
