# OpenReview Account Setup (TMLR)

## Key Point
A `.edu` email is not required to submit to OpenReview/TMLR.

## Practical Activation Guidance
- Institutional email domains (university/company/lab) are typically activated faster.
- Public-domain emails are allowed, but profile activation may be moderated and can take longer.
- If you only have a personal email, complete your profile thoroughly and request activation assistance through OpenReview feedback if needed.

## Recommended Setup Sequence
1. Create one OpenReview account (do not create duplicates).
2. Add and confirm all active emails on the same profile.
3. Set your preferred email for notifications/submission.
4. Complete profile fields (name, homepage, affiliations, expertise).
5. Confirm profile status is active before final TMLR submission.
