# Reviewer Suggestion Guide (TMLR/OpenReview)

## Goal
Suggest reviewers who can evaluate the paper technically and fairly, while avoiding any real or perceived conflict of interest.

## Customary Practice
- Suggested reviewers are optional.
- If provided, they should be active experts in the exact topic area.
- Do not suggest anyone with a conflict.

## Practical Selection Criteria
- Topic match: recent publications on LLM reasoning, deliberate search (e.g., ToT), tool-using agents, evaluation/reproducibility in LLM systems.
- Method fit: at least one reviewer with survey-methodology familiarity and at least one with systems/agent implementation depth.
- Diversity: avoid nominating all reviewers from a single institution, sub-community, or collaboration cluster.
- Independence: prioritize reviewers with no close personal or recent professional ties to the authors.

## Conflict Exclusions
- Same institution as an author (`oneZero`).
- Recent collaborators/co-authors (last 3-5 years).
- Advisor/advisee relationships.
- Any relationship that could reasonably bias review.

## Suggested Internal Note Template
Use this as a private note when entering suggestions:

`Name — Institution — Why fit (1 line) — Conflict check: clear`
