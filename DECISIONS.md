# DECISIONS

## 2026-02-19

### D-001: Two-track execution strategy
- Decision: Execute work in two phases:
  1. Blog publication version first.
  2. Original research project second.
- Why: Faster public output while preserving a rigorous research path.
- Consequence: Writing and research claims must be clearly separated.

### D-002: Split into two concrete documents now
- Decision: Create two separate drafts immediately:
  1. `drafts/tot_hf_agents_survey.md`
  2. `drafts/tot_hf_agents_novel_work_spec.md`
- Why: Reduce scope collision and enforce claim discipline early.
- Consequence: Blog and research tracks can now evolve independently.

### D-003: Use dropped HTML manuscript as Track 1 primary source
- Decision: Perform first framing and clarity pass directly in `Tree of Thoughts Meets Hugging Face Agents — ClaudDib.html`.
- Why: User requested HTML-first editing, and this is the canonical draft intended for publication flow.
- Consequence: Next Track 1 edits should continue on HTML unless intentionally backported to markdown.
