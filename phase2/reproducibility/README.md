# Reproducibility Workspace

Use this directory to make Phase 2 results fully auditable.

## Planned Files
- `run-manifest-schema.md`: required metadata fields for every run.
- `environment.md`: pinned dependencies, model versions, and system context.
- `run-log.md`: chronological run log with run IDs and outcomes.
- `run-log-protocol-v4.md`: dedicated run log for protocol-v4 smoke and confirmatory matrix execution.
- `run-log-protocol-v5.md`: dedicated run log for protocol-v5 base-pattern smoke/matrix execution.
- `run-log-protocol-v51.md`: dedicated run log for protocol-v5.1 hybrid profile execution.

No result should be considered publication-grade without entries in this directory.
