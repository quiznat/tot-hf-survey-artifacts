- `runs/`: run-level output artifacts.
  - includes baseline and `tot-prototype` demo manifests.
- `analysis/`: aggregate tables and plots.
  - `analysis/baseline_variance_report.md`: repeated baseline-run stability summary.
  - `analysis/baseline_variance_report.json`: machine-readable summary.
  - `analysis/evaluation_v1_metrics.md`: condition-level metrics table for fixed protocol.
