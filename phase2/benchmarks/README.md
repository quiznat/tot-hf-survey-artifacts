# Benchmarks Workspace

Use this directory for benchmark definitions, run results, and analysis summaries.

## Planned Files
- `benchmark-matrix.md`: task panel, baselines, and primary metrics.
- `runs/`: run-level output artifacts.
- `analysis/`: aggregate tables and plots.

All benchmark claims in manuscript drafts must trace back to files in this directory.
