    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given digits: [4, 2, 2, 4]  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using each digit **exactly once**, such that the number is divisible by **11**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility Rule for 11  \nA number is divisible by 11 **iff** the alternating sum of its digits is a multiple of 11 (including 0).  \nThat is, for a 4-digit number with digits $ a, b, c, d $ (from left to right),  \n$$\n(a + c) - (b + d) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\nSo we need to arrange the digits [4, 4, 2, 2] to maximize the number **and** satisfy:\n$$\n(a + c) - (b + d) = 0 \\text{ or } \\pm 11, \\pm 22, \\dots\n$$\nBut since digits are small (max sum = 4+4 = 8, min = 2+2 = 4), possible alternating sums range between:\n- Max (a+c) = 4+4 = 8  \n- Min (b+d) = 2+2 = 4  \nSo max alternating sum = 8 - 4 = 4  \n- Min (a+c) = 2+2 = 4  \n- Max (b+d) = 4+4 = 8  \nSo min alternating sum = 4 - 8 = -4  \nSo only possible values for $(a+c)-(b+d)$ are from -4 to 4.  \nThus, only possible multiple of 11 is **0**.\n\nSo the condition simplifies to:\n$$\na + c = b + d\n$$\n\nTotal sum of all digits = 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 12  \nSo $a + b + c + d = 12$, and $a + c = b + d = 6$\n\nSo we need to partition digits into two pairs, each summing to 6.\n\nLet\u2019s find all possible digit pairs (order doesn\u2019t matter yet) that sum to 6:\n- 4 + 2 = 6  \nWe have two 4s and two 2s, so we can pair (4,2) and (4,2) \u2014",
