    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given digits: [3, 0, 3, 0]  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer**, using **each digit exactly once**, and it must be **divisible by 5**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand divisibility by 5  \nA number is divisible by 5 **iff** its last digit is **0 or 5**.\n\nWe have digits: two 3s and two 0s. There is **no 5**, so the only possible last digit for divisibility by 5 is **0**.\n\nSo the number must end in **0**.\n\nWe have two 0s, so we can use one 0 at the end, and the other 0 can be used elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Maximize the number  \nTo make the largest possible number, we want the **leftmost digits to be as large as possible**, i.e., descending order, subject to constraints.\n\nWe have digits: 3, 3, 0, 0  \nWe must end with 0.\n\nSo remaining digits to arrange in the first three positions: [3, 3, 0]\n\nTo maximize, we want the first digit as large as possible \u2192 3  \nThen next as large as possible \u2192 3  \nThen remaining digit \u2192 0  \n\nSo candidate number: **3300**\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- Uses digits: 3, 3, 0, 0 \u2192 \u2705  \n- Is 4-digit? Yes (starts with 3) \u2192 \u2705  \n- Ends with 0 \u2192 divisible by 5 \u2192 \u2705  \n- Is there any larger possibility?\n\nWhat other arrangements ending in 0? Let\u2019s list all valid permutations ending in 0:\n\n- 3300  \n- 3030  \n- 0330 \u2192 invalid (leading 0 \u2192 not 4-digit)  \n- 3003 \u2192 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by 5  \n- 0303 \u2192 invalid (leading 0)  \n- 0033 \u2192 invalid (leading 0)  \n\nOnly valid 4-digit numbers ending in 0:  \n- 3300  \n- 3030  \n\nBetween them, **3300 > 3030**, so 3300 is largest.\n\n---\n\nFINAL: 3300",
