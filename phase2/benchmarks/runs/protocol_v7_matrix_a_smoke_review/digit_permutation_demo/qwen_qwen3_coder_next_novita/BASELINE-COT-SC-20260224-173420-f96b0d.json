    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given digits: [1, 9, 0, 8], and we must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using each digit **exactly once**, such that the number is **divisible by 6**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand divisibility by 6\nA number is divisible by 6 **iff** it is divisible by both **2** and **3**.\n\n- **Divisible by 2**: The number must be **even** \u2192 last digit must be even.\n- **Divisible by 3**: Sum of digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the sum of the digits:\n1 + 9 + 0 + 8 = **18**, which is divisible by 3 \u21d2 any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3.\n\nSo the only constraint we need to enforce is that the number is **even** (i.e., ends in 0 or 8 \u2014 the only even digits available).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the largest possible 4-digit number using these digits, ending in an even digit.\n\nWe want the **largest** number, so we want the **largest possible digits in the highest place values**, but ending in an even digit (0 or 8).\n\nLet\u2019s consider possible endings:\n\n#### Option A: Ends in 8\nThen remaining digits: [1, 9, 0] \u2192 arrange them in descending order for largest number: 9, 1, 0 \u2192 so number = 9108\n\n#### Option B: Ends in 0\nRemaining digits: [1, 9, 8] \u2192 descending order: 9, 8, 1 \u2192 so number = 9810\n\nNow compare:\n- 9810 vs 9108 \u2192 9810 is larger.\n\nCheck: Is 9810 divisible by 6?\n- Even? Yes (ends in 0).\n- Sum of digits = 9+8+1+0 = 18 \u2192 divisible by 3.\n\u2705 Yes.\n\nSo 9810 is valid and larger than 9108.\n\nAny larger? Let's confirm there\u2019s no larger arrangement ending in 0 or 8.\n\nWhat if we try ending in 0, but different ordering? To maximize, we want thousands digit as large as possible \u2192 9 is max, then hundreds as large as possible \u2192 8",
