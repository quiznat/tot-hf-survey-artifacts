    "SAMPLE 9 OUTPUT: We are given digits: [6, 3, 3, 3]  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using **each digit exactly once**, and it must be **divisible by 8**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility Rule for 8  \nA number is divisible by 8 **iff its last three digits form a number divisible by 8**.\n\nSo, for a 4-digit number `ABCD`, the number formed by `BCD` must be divisible by 8.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: List all permutations of digits [6, 3, 3, 3]  \nSince there are repeated 3s, distinct permutations are limited.\n\nAll unique permutations (4-digit numbers):\n\n- 6333  \n- 3633  \n- 3363  \n- 3336  \n\nLet\u2019s verify:  \n- 6 in thousands place: 6333  \n- 6 in hundreds place: 3633  \n- 6 in tens place: 3363  \n- 6 in units place: 3336  \n\nYes \u2014 only 4 unique numbers.\n\nNow, check which are divisible by 8.\n\nWe apply the rule: check last 3 digits.\n\n1. **6333** \u2192 last 3 digits = 333  \n   333 \u00f7 8 = 41.625 \u2192 not divisible.\n\n2. **3633** \u2192 last 3 digits = 633  \n   633 \u00f7 8 = 79.125 \u2192 not divisible.\n\n3. **3363** \u2192 last 3 digits = 363  \n   363 \u00f7 8 = 45.375 \u2192 not divisible.\n\n4. **3336** \u2192 last 3 digits = 336  \n   336 \u00f7 8 = 42 \u2192 \u2705 divisible!\n\nSo only **3336** is divisible by 8.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is 3336 the *largest possible*? Among the valid candidates, yes \u2014 but let\u2019s double-check if we missed any permutation.\n\nWe had digits [6, 3, 3, 3]. Number of distinct permutations = 4! / 3! = 4. We listed all",

    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the digits: [6, 3, 3, 3]  \nWe need to form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using each digit exactly once, and it must be **divisible by 8**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility Rule for 8  \nA number is divisible by 8 **if and only if** its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nSo, to maximize the 4-digit number, we want the **largest possible thousands digit**, then hundreds, etc. \u2014 but constrained by the divisibility rule.\n\nDigits available: one 6 and three 3s.\n\nSo possible digits in any permutation: only numbers with digits 6, 3, 3, 3 \u2014 i.e., permutations of [6,3,3,3].\n\nThere are only 4 distinct permutations (since 3s are identical):\n\n1. 6333  \n2. 3633  \n3. 3363  \n4. 3336  \n\nLet\u2019s list them and check divisibility by 8.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check each candidate\n\n#### 6333  \nLast three digits: **333**  \nCheck: 333 \u00f7 8 = 41.625 \u2192 Not divisible.\n\n#### 3633  \nLast three digits: **633**  \n633 \u00f7 8 = 79.125 \u2192 Not divisible.\n\n#### 3363  \nLast three digits: **363**  \n363 \u00f7 8 = 45.375 \u2192 Not divisible.\n\n#### 3336  \nLast three digits: **336**  \n336 \u00f7 8 = 42 \u2192 \u2705 divisible.\n\nSo only **3336** is divisible by 8.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there any other permutation? Let's double-check.\n\nDigits: 6, 3, 3, 3  \nSince three digits are identical, number of unique permutations = 4! / 3! = 4. So yes, only 4 unique numbers.\n\nAmong them, only **3336** works.\n\nBut is there a way to get a larger number than 3336 that satisfies the condition? 6333 is larger, but not divisible by 8.\n\nSo **333",
