    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given digits: [9, 1, 3, 8]  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using each digit **exactly once**, and the number must be **divisible by 6**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility by 6  \nA number is divisible by 6 **iff** it is divisible by both **2** and **3**.\n\n- **Divisibility by 2**: The number must be **even**, i.e., its last digit must be even.\n- **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet\u2019s check the digit sum:  \n9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = **21**, which is divisible by 3 \u21d2 any permutation of these digits will satisfy divisibility by 3.\n\nSo we only need to ensure the number is **even**, i.e., ends in an even digit.\n\nEven digits among [9, 1, 3, 8] \u2192 only **8** is even.\n\nSo the number **must end in 8**.\n\nNow, to make the number as large as possible, we want the **largest possible digits in the higher place values**, i.e., thousands > hundreds > tens > units.\n\nWe fix the last digit as 8 (units place). Remaining digits: [9, 1, 3]\n\nTo maximize the number, arrange the remaining digits in **descending order** for the first three places:\n\n- Thousands: 9  \n- Hundreds: 3  \n- Tens: 1  \n- Units: 8  \n\nSo candidate number: **9318**\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- Digits used: 9, 3, 1, 8 \u2192 all used once \u2705  \n- Ends in 8 \u2192 even \u2705  \n- Digit sum = 21 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2705  \n\u2192 So divisible by 6 \u2705\n\nIs there a larger permutation? Let\u2019s check other possible placements of 8 in units place:\n\nOther descending arrangements of remaining digits:\n\n- 9, 1, 3 \u2192 9138  \n- 3, 9, 1 \u2192 3918  \n- etc.\n\nBut **9318 > 9138**, and any number starting with 9 and second digit > 3 would be larger, but remaining digits are only 9, 3,",
