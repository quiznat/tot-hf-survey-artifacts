That\u2019s valid.\n\nBut hold on \u2014 is there any restriction that we must use *all four operations*? No \u2014 the problem only says \"use each number exactly once\", no requirement on operations.\n\nSo this is a valid solution.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s double-check: 10 + 7 = 17; 17 + 4 = 21; 21 + 3 = 24. Yes.\n\nSo the expression is: `10 + 7 + 4 + 3`\n\nBut maybe the problem expects more complex operations? Not necessarily \u2014 the simplest valid expression is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, other solutions exist (e.g., (10 - 7) \u00d7 (4 + 3) = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 \u2014 no), or (7 - 3) \u00d7 (10 - 4) = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 \u2014 yes!

Let\u2019s pick the multiplication one since it\u2019s more \"interesting\", but both are correct.\n\nLet\u2019s verify: (7 - 3) \u00d7 (10 - 4) = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 \u2705\n\nSo final answer: `(7 - 3) * (10 - 4)`\n\nBut note: the sample format uses `/` for division, but for multiplication we can use `*` or `\u00d7`. Since programming-friendly, `*` is safe.\n\nAlternatively, using standard math notation: `(7 - 3",

    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers [4, 10, 7, 3] and must use each exactly once (and only once) with basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses allowed) to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possibilities.\n\nFirst, consider common 24 combinations:\n- 6 \u00d7 4 = 24  \n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24  \n- 12 \u00d7 2 = 24  \n- 48 \u00f7 2 = 24  \n- 7 \u00d7 3 + 3 = 24 (but we only have one 3)  \n- 10 + 7 + 4 + 3 = 24 \u2192 10 + 7 = 17, +4 = 21, +3 = 24 \u2192 **Yes!**\n\nWait \u2014 10 + 7 + 4 + 3 = 24. That uses all four numbers exactly once.\n\nCheck: 10 + 7 = 17, 17 + 4 = 21, 21 + 3 = 24 \u2705\n\nSo the expression is simply:  \n**10 + 7 + 4 + 3**\n\nThat\u2019s valid \u2014 uses each number once, only addition, gives 24.\n\nNo need for parentheses or other operations.\n\nFINAL: 10 + 7 + 4 + 3",
