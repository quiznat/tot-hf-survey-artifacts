    "SAMPLE 9 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [3, 4, 4, 8], and we must use each **exactly once** to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations.\n\nFirst, note common ways to get 24:  \n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2192 then we need to neutralize the two 4s (e.g., 4 \u2212 4 = 0, so 8\u00d73 + (4\u22124) = 24). That works!\n\nCheck:  \n8 \u00d7 3 = 24  \n4 \u2212 4 = 0  \n24 + 0 = 24  \nAll numbers used exactly once.\n\nSo expression:  \n**(8 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u2212 4) = 24**\n\nBut let\u2019s verify if parentheses are needed for clarity. Yes \u2014 without them, 8 \u00d7 3 + 4 \u2212 4 = 24 anyway due to left-to-right, but to be safe and clear, we can write:\n\n**8 \u00d7 3 + 4 \u2212 4**\n\nBut wait: 8 \u00d7 3 + 4 \u2212 4 = 24 + 4 \u2212 4 = 24. Yes, works even without parentheses.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"use each number exactly once\", and this uses 8, 3, 4, 4 \u2014 all once.\n\nAlternative: (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but we don\u2019t have 2.\n\nAnother idea: (4 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 but then 8 is unused. Need to use all four numbers.\n\nSo must incorporate all four.\n\nAnother possibility: 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4)? Let's check: 4 \u00f7 4 = 1, 4 \u2212 1 = 3, 8 \u00d7 3 = 24. That uses 8, 4, 4, 4 \u2014 but we only have **two** 4s, not three. So invalid.\n\nBack to our earlier idea: 8 \u00d7 3 + 4 \u2212 4 = 24 \u2014 uses 8, 3, 4, 4 \u2014 perfect.\n\nWe could also write: (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 again, no 2.\n\nOr: 4 \u00d7 (8 \u2212 4 \u00f7",

    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [3, 4, 4, 8], and we must use each **exactly once** to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possibilities.\n\nFirst, recall common 24 combinations:  \n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2192 need to make the 4 and 4 cancel or become 1 (e.g., 4 \u00f7 4 = 1), then multiply: 8 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24. But that uses multiplication of all four numbers: 8 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24. That uses all numbers exactly once.\n\nCheck:  \n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24  \n- 4 \u00f7 4 = 1  \n- 24 \u00d7 1 = 24  \nYes!

Both are valid.\n\nBut note: in 4 \u00d7 (8 \u2212 3) + 4, the two 4s are used \u2014 one as multiplier, one as added \u2014 fine.\n\nLet\u2019s check precedence: multiplication before addition, so yes: 4 \u00d7 (8 \u2212 3) = 20, then +4 = 24.\n\nSo expression: **4 \u00d7 (8 \u2212 3) + 4**\n\nAlternatively, (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) is invalid (no 2).  \nAnother: (8 \u00f7 (4 \u2212 3)) \u00d7 3?
