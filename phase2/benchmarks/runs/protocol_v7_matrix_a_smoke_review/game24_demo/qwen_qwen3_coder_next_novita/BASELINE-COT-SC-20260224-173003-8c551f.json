    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [6, 4, 10, 4], and we must use each exactly once to make 24, using standard arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses allowed).\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations.\n\nFirst, note that 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, but we have two 4s and a 10 left, so we need to \u201cneutralize\u201d the extra numbers (e.g., make them cancel or multiply to 1).\n\nIdea: Try to form 24 as (something) \u00d7 (something else), or via sum/difference.\n\nTry: (10 \u2212 4) = 6, then we have 6, 4, and 6 left \u2192 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, but we still have another 6 \u2014 not helpful.\n\nTry: 10 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 24? 10 + 4 = 14, +6 = 20, +4 = 24 \u2192 yes! Wait, 10 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 24. That uses all numbers exactly once.\n\nCheck: 10 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 24 \u2705\n\nSo expression is: 10 + 4 + 6 + 4\n\nBut let\u2019s verify: numbers used: 10, 4, 6, 4 \u2014 yes, both 4s used, each exactly once.\n\nNo need for parentheses or other ops \u2014 addition is associative and commutative, so order doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nSo simplest is: 10 + 4 + 6 + 4\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there any restriction against just adding? The problem says \"use each number exactly once to produce 24\" \u2014 no other constraints. So this is valid.\n\nAlternative: maybe they expect multiplication? But addition works.\n\nDouble-check: 10 + 4 = 14, 14 + 6 = 20, 20 + 4 = 24 \u2014 correct.\n\nThus, final answer is:\n\nFINAL: 10 + 4 + 6 + 4",
