So if we can get rid of the two 1s (i.e., make them multiply to 1 or add to 0, etc.), we could do 6 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 (1 + 1 \u2212 1) \u2014 but that uses three 1s.

The problem doesn\u2019t specify allowed operations, but usually only +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses are assumed unless stated.
