    "STEP 1 MODEL: Thought 1: We need to reach the target 57 using the numbers [5, 14, 19, 19, 19]. Since no tools are available, we must combine the numbers using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses) to get 57. Let's explore combinations.\n\nWe have three 19s: 19 \u00d7 3 = 57. Indeed, 19 + 19 + 19 = 57. That uses three of the numbers. The remaining numbers are 5 and 14, but we don\u2019t need to use all numbers unless specified \u2014 however, benchmark tasks like this usually require using *all* numbers exactly once. Let\u2019s verify the problem statement: it says \u201cusing the numbers [5, 14, 19, 19, 19]\u201d \u2014 typically in such puzzles, all numbers must be used exactly once.\n\nSo we must use all five numbers: 5, 14, 19, 19, 19 \u2192 target 57.\n\nTry: 19 + 19 + 19 = 57, but then we have 5 and 14 left. We need to incorporate them in a way that cancels out (e.g., +14 \u221214, but we only have one 14), or use operations like (14 \u2212 5 \u2212 9) \u2014 but no 9.\n\nAlternative: maybe (19 \u00d7 3) + (5 \u2212 14) = 57 \u2212 9 = 48 \u2192 too low.\n\nWhat about (19 + 19) + (19 + 5 \u2212 14) = 38 + (24 \u2212 14?) Wait: 19 + 5 = 24; 24 \u2212 14 = 10; 38 + 10 = 48 again.\n\nTry multiplication: 14 + 5 = 19, so we have 19 (from 14+5), and three 19s \u2192 four 19s \u2192 19\u00d74 = 76 \u2014 too high.\n\nBut 19\u00d73 = 57, so if we can make the extra 5 and 14 combine to 0: e.g., 14 \u2212",

So:  \n(19 \u2212 14) = 5, and we have a 5 \u2192 5 + 5 = 10.

Yes: 19 + (5 \u2212 5) \u2014 but only one 5. Or 14 + 5 = 19 \u2014 perfect!  \nSo: (19 + 19) + (14 + 5) = 38 + 19 = 57 \u2014 but that uses only four numbers: two 19s, 14, 5. We still have a third 19 unused.  \nWait \u2014 we have three 19s. So maybe: (19 + 19 + 19) = 57, and (14 \u2212 14) would cancel, but only one 14.  \nHold on \u2014 what if we do: 19 \u00d7 (14 \u2212 5) \u2212 19 \u2212 19? That\u2019s 19\u00d79 = 171; 1",

Then 19 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 14/19)? Let's compute exactly:  \n14/19 is a fraction. 5 \u2212 14/19 = (95 \u2212 14)/19 = 81/19.
