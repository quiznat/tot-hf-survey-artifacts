So 22 + 14 + 2 = 38 \u2192 plus 24 = 62. That\u2019s [2,14,22,24].

    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24]  \nTarget sum: 62  \nEach number can be used at most once.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a subset that sums to 62.\n\nFirst, total sum of all numbers:  \n2 + 6 = 8  \n8 + 14 = 22  \n22 + 18 = 40  \n40 + 22 = 62  \n62 + 24 = 86  \n\nSo total = 86.
