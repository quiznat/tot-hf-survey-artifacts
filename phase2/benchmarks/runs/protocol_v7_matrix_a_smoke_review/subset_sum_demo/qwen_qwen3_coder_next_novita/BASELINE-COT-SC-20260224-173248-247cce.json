    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the list: [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 22]  \nTarget: 17  \nWe need to pick a subset (each number used at most once) that sums to 17.\n\nLet\u2019s try combinations:\n\nStart with smaller numbers:\n\n- Try 3 + 5 = 8 \u2192 need 9 more. Remaining numbers: 6,8,11,... \u2014 6+3=9 but 3 used. 8+1? no 1. 6+? 9-6=3 used. So no.\n\n- 3 + 6 = 9 \u2192 need 8 \u2192 8 is available! So 3 + 6 + 8 = 17 \u2705\n\nCheck: 3 + 6 = 9, 9 + 8 = 17 \u2014 yes.\n\nAre there others? Let\u2019s verify uniqueness:  \n3, 6, 8 are all in the list and distinct.\n\nOther combos?  \n5 + 6 = 11 \u2192 need 6 more \u2014 6 used.  \n5 + 8 = 13 \u2192 need 4 \u2014 no 4.  \n3 + 11 = 14 \u2192 need 3 \u2014 3 used.  \n5 + 11 = 16 \u2192 need 1 \u2014 no.  \n6 + 11 = 17 \u2705 \u2192 6 + 11 = 17 \u2014 also valid!\n\nWait \u2014 6 + 11 = 17. Both numbers are in the list.\n\nSo we have at least two solutions:  \n- [3, 6, 8]  \n- [6, 11]\n\nBut the instruction says: \u201cSelect one or more values\u2026 Return only a comma-separated list of chosen numbers.\u201d  \nIt does not require all solutions \u2014 just *a* solution.\n\nWe need to return *one* valid subset.\n\nWhich to pick? Either is fine.\n\nLet\u2019s verify both:\n\n- 6 + 11 = 17 \u2714  \n- 3 + 6 + 8 = 17 \u2714\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nWe should pick one.\n\nLet\u2019s consider smaller subset: [6, 11] has only two numbers vs three \u2014 preferable for brevity.\n\nSo final answer: 6,11\n\nNote: Order doesn\u2019t matter, but typically ascending order",
