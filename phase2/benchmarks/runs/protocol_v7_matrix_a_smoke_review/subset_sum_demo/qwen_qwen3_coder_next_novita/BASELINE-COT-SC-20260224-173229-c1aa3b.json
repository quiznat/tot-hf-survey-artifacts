There are two 9s. So 21 + 9 = 30 \u2192 valid.  \n  So one solution is [21, 9].\n\nCheck if others exist (but problem only asks to select one or more values \u2014 any valid subset is acceptable). However, we should ensure we\u2019re not missing a more unique or required answer \u2014 but the instruction says \"Select one or more values... so their sum equals the target\", and to return *a* comma-separated list (any valid one). So 21,9 works.\n\nBut note: there are two 9s \u2014 using one is fine.\n\nLet\u2019s verify: 21 + 9 = 30 \u2705  \nNumbers used: 21 and one 9 \u2014 both in list, used once.\n\nAlternative combinations for verification:\n\n- 16 + 10 + 4 = 30 \u2705 (16+10=26, +4=30) \u2014 also valid.  \n- 9 + 9 + 8 + 4 = 30? 9+9=18, +8=26, +4=30 \u2014 yes!  \n- 10 + 9 + 8 + 1 + ? = 28 + ? \u2014 need 2 more, not available.  \n- 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 30? 16+9=25, +4=29, +1=30 \u2014 yes! Many options.\n\nSo multiple valid answers. We just need to provide one.\n\nLet\u2019s pick: 21,9 \u2014 simplest (two numbers).\n\nBut wait: which 9 to pick? Since two 9s exist, and we\u2019re only using one, it's fine.\n\nReturn as comma-separated: 21,9\n\nFINAL: 21,9",
