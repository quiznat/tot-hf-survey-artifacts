    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 4, 4, 5]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer what might be expected. Common benchmark tasks with lists include computing the sum, mean, product, median, mode, etc. Given the presence of the `calc` tool, it likely supports arithmetic operations. Let me consider possible interpretations:\n\n- Sum: 2 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 15  \n- Mean: 15 / 4 = 3.75  \n- Product: 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 = 160  \n- Median: sorted list is [2, 4, 4, 5]; median = (4 + 4)/2 = 4  \n- Mode: 4 (appears twice)  \n\nSince no specific instruction is given, and the most basic operation",
