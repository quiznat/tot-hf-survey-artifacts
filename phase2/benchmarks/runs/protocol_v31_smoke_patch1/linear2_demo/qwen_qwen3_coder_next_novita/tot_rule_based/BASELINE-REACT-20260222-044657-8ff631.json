    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n1) a1*x + b1*y = c1  \n2) a2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nSo here:  \nEquation 1: 2x - 4y = 22  \nEquation 2: -3x - 4y = 17  \n\nWe can solve this system using algebraic methods (e.g., elimination or substitution). Let's try elimination:  \nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 (or vice versa) to eliminate y, since both have -4y.  \n\n(2x - 4y) - (-3x - 4y) = 22 - 17  \n\u2192 2x - 4y",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The scratchpad shows the setup of the system: 2x - 4y = 22 and -3x - 4y = 17. To eliminate y, subtract the second equation from the first: (2x - (-3x)) + (-4y - (-4y)) = 22 - 17 \u2192 5x + 0 = 5 \u2192 x = 1. Then substitute x = 1 into one equation to find y. Using first equation: 2(1) - 4y = 22 \u2192 2 - 4y = 22 \u2192 -4y = 20 \u2192 y = -5. So solution is (x=1, y=-5). Since the available tools include solve2, which likely solves 2x2 systems directly, I should use that tool with the coefficient matrix and constants. The input format for solve",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The scratchpad correctly derives the solution: subtracting the second equation from the first eliminates y, giving 5x = 5 \u2192 x = 1. Substituting x = 1 into 2x - 4y = 22 yields y = -5. The solution is (x=1, y=-5). Since the tool `solve2` is available and designed for solving 2x2 systems, I should invoke it with the coefficient matrix and constants. The input format likely expects the coefficients as [[a1, b1], [a2, b2]] and constants as [c1, c2], or possibly the augmented form. Given the task input is [[2, -4, 22], [-3, -4, 17]], `solve2` probably accepts this exact format. I'll use `solve2` with the provided equations.",
