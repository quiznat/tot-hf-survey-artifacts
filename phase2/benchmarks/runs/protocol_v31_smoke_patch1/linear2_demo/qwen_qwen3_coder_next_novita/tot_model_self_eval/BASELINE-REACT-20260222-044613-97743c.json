    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in two variables, represented as augmented matrices:  \nEquation 1: 2x - 4y = 22  \nEquation 2: -3x - 4y = 17  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can use algebraic methods (e.g., elimination or substitution) or use the provided tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2\u00d72 linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the coefficient matrix and constants \u2014 possibly as a list of equations like [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]] representing a1*x + b1*y = c1, etc. That matches the input format exactly.\n\nSo, ACTION: solve2 [[2, -4,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned the solution x = 1.000000, y = -5.000000. Let's verify this solution using the original equations to ensure correctness.\n\nEquation 1: 2x - 4y = 22  \nPlug in x = 1, y = -5:  \n2(1) - 4(-5) = 2 + 20 = 22 \u2705\n\nEquation 2: -3x - 4y = 17  \nPlug in x = 1, y = -5:  \n-3(1) - 4(-5) = -3 + 20 = 17 \u2705\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\n\nFINAL: x=1,y=-5"
