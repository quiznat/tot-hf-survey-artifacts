    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays: [[4, 9, -9], [9, -1, 86]]. Assuming these represent linear equations in two variables x and y, the format is likely [a, b, c] meaning a*x + b*y = c. So the system is:\n1) 4x + 9y = -9  \n2) 9x - y = 86  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a 2-variable system, and the input matches that, I should use `solve2` with the equations.\n\nBut first, confirm format: `solve2` probably expects the equations as a list of lists, or maybe as two equations. Since the input is already in that form, I'll pass the entire `equations",
