    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [7, 1, 6, 5] and is divisible by 7, with the oracle indicating the maximum possible such number is 7651. However, I need to verify this using the available tools: `best_divisible` and `is_divisible`. Since `best_divisible` likely returns the best (largest) number formed from the digits divisible by the divisor, I should call it first. If it returns 7651, then I can verify with `is_divisible(7651, 7)` to confirm. But first, let's consider: 7651 is the given `oracle_max`, so maybe it's the answer, but I need to validate using tools. Since `best_divisible` is likely designed for this purpose, I'll call it directly.",
