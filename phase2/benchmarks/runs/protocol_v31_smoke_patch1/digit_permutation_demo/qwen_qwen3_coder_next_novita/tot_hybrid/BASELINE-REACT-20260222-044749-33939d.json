    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (8) that can be formed using the digits [1, 2, 4, 1]. The oracle_max is 4112, which suggests that the maximum possible number formed by these digits is 4211 (since digits are [1,2,4,1], permutations include 4211, 4121, 4112, etc.). But 4112 is given as oracle_max, possibly meaning the largest valid number divisible by 8 is 4112. Let's verify:  \n- A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.  \n- For 4112: last three digits = 112. 112 \u00f7 8 = 14 \u2192 divisible.  \n- Can we",

The oracle_max is 4112, which is likely the correct answer, but I need to verify it's achievable and maximal. First, check if 4112 can be formed from the digits: digits of 4112 are [4, 1, 1, 2] \u2014 matches [1, 2, 4, 1]. Next, confirm divisibility by 8: last three digits = 112, and 112 \u00f7 8 = 14 \u2192 divisible. Now, check if any larger permutation of [1,2,4,1] is divisible by 8.

Now check if any larger permutation exists. Permutations of [1,2,4,1] in descending order:  \n- 4211: last three digits = 211 \u2192 211 \u00f7 8 = 26.375 \u2192 not divisible  \n- 4121: last three digits = 121",
