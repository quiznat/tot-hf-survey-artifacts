    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 2, 3, 2] that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum is 5322. Let's verify if 5322 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. For divisibility by 2: last digit is 2 \u2192 even \u2192 OK. For divisibility by 3: sum of digits = 5+3+2+2 = 12, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 OK. So 5322 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says it's the max, and it's valid, the answer should be 5322. But to be thorough, maybe I should confirm using the tools. Let's use `is_div",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum is 5322. I verified that 5322 is divisible by 6 (even and digit sum 12 divisible by 3). To be rigorous, I should confirm using the `is_divisible` tool that 5322 is indeed divisible by 6, and possibly check if any larger permutation exists \u2014 but since 5322 is the largest possible permutation of [5,2,3,2] (digits sorted descending: 5,3,2,2), and it's divisible by 6, it must be the answer. Still, using `is_divisible` to validate is good practice.  \nACTION: is_divisible 5322 6",
