    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4, and we're told the oracle_max is 9852. Let's verify if 9852 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits of 9852 are 52, and 52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so yes, 9852 is divisible by 4. Since 9852 is the maximum possible permutation of those digits (9 > 8 > 5 > 2), and it's divisible by 4, it must be the answer. Let's confirm using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 9852 4",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: yes"
