    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 8 that can be formed by rearranging the digits [1, 2, 4, 1].

Let's verify:  \n- Digits: [1, 2, 4, 1] \u2192 possible permutations include 4112, 4121, 4211, 2411, etc.  \n- 4112 \u00f7 8 = 514 \u2192 exact division, so 4112 is divisible by 8.  \n- Is there a larger permutation?

Since the action was invalid or incomplete, I need to retry with the correct format. Let me first verify if 4112 is divisible by 8 using the proper tool call. If it is, then I should check whether any larger permutation (like 4211 or 4121) is also divisible by 8 \u2014 but since 4211 > 4112, and 4112 is the oracle_max, it's possible 4211 and 4121 are not divisible by 8.
