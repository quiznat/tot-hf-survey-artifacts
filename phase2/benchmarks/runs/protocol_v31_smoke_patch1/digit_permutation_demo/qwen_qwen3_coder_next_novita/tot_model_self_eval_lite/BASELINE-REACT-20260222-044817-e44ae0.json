    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 8, 4, 6] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 3, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 8664. Let's verify if 8664 is divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Digits of 8664: 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 24, and 24 is divisible by 3, so 8664 is divisible by 3. Also, 8664 uses digits [8,6,6,4] which matches the given digits [6,8,4,6] (two 6s, one 8, one 4). So 8664 is a",

The oracle says the maximum possible is 8664. We verified that 8664 uses the correct digits (two 6s, one 8, one 4) and that its digit sum is 8+6+6+4 = 24, which is divisible by 3, so 8664 is divisible by 3. Since it's the largest possible permutation of those digits (8664 > 8646 > 8466 > etc.), and it satisfies the divisibility condition, it must be the answer. We can confirm using the `is_divisible` tool to double-check.",
