    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 1, 5, 6] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 6531, which suggests that 6531 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible permutation and divisible by 7). Let's verify:  \n- Digits of 6531 are 6,5,3,1 \u2014 matches the given digits.  \n- Check divisibility by 7: 6531 \u00f7 7 = 933 exactly? Let's compute: 7 \u00d7 933 = 6531 (since 7\u00d7900=6300, 7\u00d733=231, 6300+231=6531). Yes",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 6531, and we've verified that 6531 uses the digits [3,1,5,6] exactly once and is divisible by 7 (since 7 \u00d7 933 = 6531). Since it's the largest possible permutation of those digits (6531 > 6513 > 6351, etc.), and it satisfies the divisibility condition, it must be the correct answer. No further checks are needed.\nFINAL: 6531"
