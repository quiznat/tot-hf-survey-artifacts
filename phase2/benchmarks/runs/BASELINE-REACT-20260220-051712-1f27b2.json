    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [1, 3, 10, 10]. The available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with such inputs involve computing a result like sum, product, or perhaps evaluating an expression using the numbers in order. Given the numbers, a plausible interpretation is to compute the sum: 1 + 3 + 10 + 10 = 24. Alternatively, maybe it's to compute something like (1 + 3) * (10 - 10) = 0, but that seems less likely without more context. Since the simplest and most standard operation is summing the list, I'll try that using `calc`. I'll use `calc` with the sum expression.\n\nACTION: calc 1 + 3 + 10",

I need to recompute with all four numbers.\n\nACTION: calc 1 + 3 + 10 + 10\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: 24\nFINAL: 24",
