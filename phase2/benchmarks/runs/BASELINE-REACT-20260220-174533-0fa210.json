    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [1, 1, 5, 5], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific task is given (e.g., compute sum, product, etc.), I need to infer the most likely benchmark task \u2014 often such puzzles involve using the numbers with arithmetic operations to reach a target (e.g., 24 game).
