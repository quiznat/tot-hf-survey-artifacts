    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 4, 5, 10]. The available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since the task is not explicitly specified, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with a list of numbers include computing the sum, product, average, or identifying a pattern. Given the numbers 2, 4, 5, 10, a plausible interpretation is to compute the sum: 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 21. Alternatively, maybe it's to compute the product: 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10 = 400. Or perhaps find the least common multiple (LCM) or greatest common divisor (GCD). Without more context, the most straightforward is sum. Let me try using `calc` to compute the sum.\n\nACTION: calc 2 +",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `calc` tool likely expects a complete arithmetic expression, not a partial one like \"2 +\". My earlier attempt was incomplete and caused a parsing error. I need to provide a full expression. Let me try computing the sum of all numbers: 2 + 4 + 5 + 10. That should be a valid expression for `calc`.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 4 + 5 + 10",
