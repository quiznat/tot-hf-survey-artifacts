    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [2, 2, 8, 8], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the numbers [2, 2, 8, 8] with arithmetic operations to reach 24. Let me try to find such an expression.\n\nPossible approaches:\n- Try combinations: 8 \u00d7 (2 + 2) = 32 \u2192 too high.\n- 8 \u00d7 2 + 8 = 24, but we have two 2s, so 8 \u00d7 2 + 8 = 24 uses only one 2. Need to use all four numbers: 2, 2, 8, 8.\n- Try: (8 + 8) \u00d7 (2 / 2) = 16",

We need to use all four numbers: 2, 2, 8, 8, each exactly once, with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses, to get 24.\n\nTry:  \n- 8 \u00d7 (8 \u2212 2) \u2212 2 = 8 \u00d7 6 \u2212 2 = 48 \u2212 2 = 46 \u2192 too high  \n- 8 \u00d7 (2 + 2) \u2212 8 = 8 \u00d7 4 \u2212 8 = 32 \u2212 8 = 24 \u2705  \nYes!
