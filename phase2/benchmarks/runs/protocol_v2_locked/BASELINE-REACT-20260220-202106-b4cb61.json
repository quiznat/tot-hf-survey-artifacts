Perhaps looking at the differences between consecutive numbers or trying to form equations might help.\n\nLet me try calculating the average of these numbers since that's another common operation:\n\nACTION: calc (1 + 1 + 4 + 8) / 4\n\nScratchpad:\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: 3.5\nSTEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I've calculated the average of the numbers [1, 1, 4, 8], which is",

While other operations like sum (14) and product (32) are valid calculations, the average provides a central tendency measure that's commonly used to describe such data sets."
