    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task using the available tools. The task input is [3, 6, 6, 9] and I have access to a calculator tool called \"calc\". Since no specific operation is requested, I should first understand what kind of calculation might be appropriate. Looking at these numbers, I could calculate various things like sum, mean, or other operations. Let me start by calculating the sum as that's often a good starting point.\n\nACTION: calc 3 + 6 + 6 + 9\n\nFINAL: 24",
