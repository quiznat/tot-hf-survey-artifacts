    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [2, 5, 5, 7]. Since I only have access to a calculator tool, I should consider what mathematical operation would be most appropriate. Given that this is a benchmark task, it might be asking for a specific calculation like finding the sum, average, or some other statistical measure.

Since no specific operation was mentioned, and both sum and average are common benchmark calculations, I should check if there are other interpretations. The numbers [2, 5, 5, 7] could also be interpreted as a set where I might need to find the median, mode, or range. Let me calculate the median which is another common benchmark statistic.\n\nACTION: calc median of [2, 5, 5, 7]\n\nFINAL: 5.0\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: 5.0\nSTEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I've now calculated three different benchmark statistics:\n1.

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I need to reconsider my approach. The task is asking me to solve a benchmark task with input [2, 5, 5, 7], but I don't have clear instructions on what specific benchmark operation to perform. I've already calculated the sum (19), average (4.75), and median (5.0). Since the problem asks for \"a benchmark task\" without specifying which one, and given that the sum is the most straightforward interpretation of a \"benchmark task\" with these numbers, I'll provide the sum as my final answer. The error in the previous step was due to an invalid expression for median calculation, so I should stick to valid calculations.\n\nFINAL: 19"
