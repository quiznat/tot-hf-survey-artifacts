I should try a different approach, perhaps breaking down the calculation into smaller steps to see if that works.\n\nACTION: calc \"2 + 4\"\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: 6\nTHINK: The calculation worked for the first two numbers. I will continue with the next two numbers and then add the results together.\n\nACTION: calc \"8 + 10\"\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: 18\nTHINK: Now that I have the sums of the pairs, I can add them together to get the final result.\n\nACTION: calc \"6 + 18\"\nSTEP 4 OBSERVATION: 24\nFINAL: 24",
