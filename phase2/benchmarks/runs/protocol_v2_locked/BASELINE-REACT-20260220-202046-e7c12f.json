    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given list [2, 4, 8, 10] and determine what operation would be most useful. Since I have access to a calculator tool, I should consider what mathematical operations might be relevant. Looking at the numbers, they appear to be increasing, but not in a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern. Let me try calculating the differences between consecutive numbers to see if there's a pattern.\n\nACTION: calc 4 - 2\n\nScratchpad:",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I calculated the difference between the first two numbers (4 - 2 = 2). Now let me calculate the differences between the remaining consecutive pairs to identify the pattern: 8 - 4 = 4, and 10 - 8 = 2. The differences are 2, 4, 2. This suggests an alternating pattern where we add 2, then add 4, then add 2 again. To continue this sequence, I should add 4 to the last number (10 + 4 = 14). Let me verify this pattern makes sense by checking if it's consistent with the original sequence: 2, 4 (2+2), 8 (4+4), 10 (8+2), next should be 14 (10+4).\n\nACTION: calc 10 + 4\n\nScratchpad:\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION:",
