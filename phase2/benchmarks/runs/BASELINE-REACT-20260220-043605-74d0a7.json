    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [1, 1, 2, 7], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., compute a value, find a pattern, or solve an equation), I need to infer the likely intent. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve computing a result like sum, product, or applying some operation. Given the numbers [1, 1, 2, 7], possible interpretations:\n\n- Sum: 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 = 11  \n- Product: 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 7 = 14  \n- Concatenation? Unlikely with `calc` tool.  \n- Maybe forming numbers: 1, 1, 2, 7 \u2192 1127? But `calc` probably expects expressions",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [1, 1, 2, 7], and the only tool available is `calc`, which likely evaluates mathematical expressions. Since no explicit goal is specified, the most common benchmark interpretation for a list of numbers is to compute a simple aggregate \u2014 typically the sum or product. Let\u2019s try the sum first, as it\u2019s the most straightforward. Sum = 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 = 11. I\u2019ll use `calc` to verify.\nACTION: calc 1 + 1 + 2 + 7",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The `calc` tool returned 11 for the sum 1 + 1 + 2 + 7, which matches my expectation. Since the task is a benchmark with input [1, 1, 2, 7] and only the `calc` tool available, and no further instructions, the most reasonable interpretation is to compute the sum. The result is 11. I should now finalize the answer.\nFINAL: 11"
