So expression: `10 + 4 + 6 + 4`\n\nBut hold on \u2014 is there any restriction against just adding? The problem says \"use each number exactly once\", and operations are not restricted \u2014 so addition is fine.\n\nSo one valid expression is: `10 + 4 + 6 + 4`\n\nBut wait \u2014 order doesn't matter in addition, and all numbers used once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect more complex operations, but the simplest valid solution is acceptable.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check: Are there any hidden rules? The problem says \u201cUse each number exactly once to produce 24.\u201d No restriction on operations.\n\nSo `10 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 24` is correct.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the numbers are [6, 4, 10, 4], so two 4s \u2014 and we used both.\n\nThus, final answer:  \n`10 + 4 + 6 + 4`\n\nBut let\u2019s see if any trick is needed \u2014 sometimes in 24 game, you must use exactly four numbers and all four operations? No \u2014 standard 24 game only requires using all numbers, each once, with any operations and parentheses.\n\nSo addition",
