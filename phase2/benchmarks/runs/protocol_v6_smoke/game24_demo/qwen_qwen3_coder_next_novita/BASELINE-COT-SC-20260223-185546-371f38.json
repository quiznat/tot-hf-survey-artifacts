    "SAMPLE 9 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [3, 4, 4, 8], and we must use each **exactly once** to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possible combinations.\n\nWe know 3 \u00d7 8 = 24, but then we\u2019d have two 4s left \u2014 need to incorporate them without changing the value (e.g., via +0 or \u00d71). So maybe:  \n(3 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24.  \nThat uses all numbers: 3, 8, 4, 4 \u2014 each once.\n\nCheck:  \n4 \u00f7 4 = 1  \n3 \u00d7 8 = 24  \n24 \u00d7 1 = 24 \u2705\n\nThis is valid.\n\nAlternative:  \n(8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but no 2.  \n(4 \u00d7 4) + 8 = 24, but then 3 is unused.  \n8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4) = 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2192 uses 8, 4, 4, 3 \u2014 wait: 4 \u00f7 4 uses two 4s, and the outer 3 comes from... Hmm, in that expression, where does 3 come from? Actually:  \n8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4) = 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 but we don\u2019t have a 3 *number*; the 3 arises from the computation (4 \u2212 1). So this uses only 8 and two 4s \u2014 missing the 3. So invalid unless we explicitly include the given 3.\n\nBut in our first expression:  \n(3 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4)  \nNumbers used: 3, 8, 4, 4 \u2014 perfect.\n\nOther possibilities:  \n4 \u00d7 (8 \u2212 4) + 3 = 4 \u00d7 4 + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 \u274c  \n(4 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 24, but 8 is unused.  \n(8 \u00f7 (4 \u2212 3)) \u00d7 4 = (8 \u00f7 1) \u00d7 4 = 32 \ufffd",

    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers [3, 4, 4, 8] and must use each exactly once to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s try combinations:\n\nFirst, note common 24 combinations:  \n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2192 need to neutralize the two 4s (e.g., +4\u22124 or \u00d7(4/4)), but must use all numbers.\n\nTry:  \n(8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24 \u2705  \nUses 8, 3, 4, 4 \u2014 all exactly once.\n\nAlternative:  \n8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4) = 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2705  \nAlso uses all numbers.\n\nLet\u2019s verify the second:  \n4 \u00f7 4 = 1  \n4 \u2212 1 = 3  \n8 \u00d7 3 = 24  \nYes \u2014 uses 8, 4, 4, 3 exactly once.\n\nWhich is simpler? Both are valid. Let\u2019s pick the second one:  \n8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4) = 24\n\nBut wait: order of operations \u2014 division before subtraction, so parentheses are needed only around (4 \u00f7 4), and then 4 \u2212 that result. So expression:  \n8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 (4 \u00f7 4))  \nor more cleanly:  \n8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4)  \nSince \u00f7 has higher precedence than \u2212, it\u2019s fine without extra parentheses.\n\nBut to be unambiguous and ensure correctness, we can write:  \n8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4)\n\nAlternatively, the first idea:  \n(8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24  \nAlso valid.\n\nWhich one is more standard? Both are acceptable.\n\nLet\u2019s choose:  \n8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4)\n\nDouble-check:  \n4 \u00f7 4 = 1  \n4 \u2212 1 = 3  \n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2705\n\nAll numbers used: 8, 4, 4, 3 \u2014 yes.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nFINAL: 8 \u00d7 (4 - 4 \u00f7 4)",
