Maybe subtract or divide by something involving it.\n\nIdea: Use division to neutralize extra 10: e.g., \u00d7 (10/10) = \u00d71.\n\nSo: (10 \u2212 2) \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (10 / 10) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24. But that uses 10, 2, 3, 10 \u2014 yes! All four numbers used exactly once.\n\nCheck:  \n(10 \u2212 2) = 8  \n8 \u00d7 3 = 24  \n10 / 10 = 1  \n24 \u00d7 1 = 24 \u2705\n\nBut is multiplication by 1 allowed? Yes \u2014 standard 24 game rules allow any operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses), and using numbers as divisors is",
