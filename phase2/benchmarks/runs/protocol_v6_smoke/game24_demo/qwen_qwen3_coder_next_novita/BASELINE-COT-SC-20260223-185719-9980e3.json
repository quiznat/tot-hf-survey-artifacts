Yes: 1 \u2212 1 = 0.\n\nSo: (6 \u00d7 4) \u00d7 (1 \u2212 1) = 24 \u00d7 0 = 0 \u2192 no.\n\nOr: (6 \u00d7 4) + (1 \u2212 1) = 24 + 0 = 24 \u2705\n\nThat works!

So if we can make the two 1s cancel out or become 1 (i.e., multiply by 1 or add 0), that might work.\n\nFor example:\n- (6 \u00d7 4) \u00d7 (1 + 1 \u2212 1) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24 \u2014 but that uses three 1s; we only have two.\n\nBut we have exactly two 1s.\n\nWhat if we do: (6 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 something? 6 + 1 + 1 = 8, and 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, but we don\u2019t have a 3.\n\nWhat about (6 \u00d7 1 + 6) \u00d7 something? No, only one 6.\n\nTry using division: 6 / (1 \u2212 1/4) = ?\n\nCompute: 1/4 = 0.25, so 1 \u2212 0.25 = 0.75, and 6 / 0.75 = 8.
