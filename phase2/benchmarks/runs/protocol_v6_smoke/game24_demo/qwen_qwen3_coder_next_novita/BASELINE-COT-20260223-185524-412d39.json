    "OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [3, 4, 4, 8], and we must use each **exactly once** to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s try to think of combinations that yield 24.\n\nSome known facts:\n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, so if we can make the other two numbers (4 and 4) cancel out or become 1 (e.g., via division), that might work.\n- 4 + 4 = 8, and 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 but then we\u2019d have used 8 twice (one original 8 and the 4+4 = 8), but we only have one 8. So that\u2019s not valid unless we use the original 8 and the sum of 4+4 in a multiplication: (4 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 but then we haven\u2019t used the 8. So we need to incorporate the 8.\n\nTry:  \n(8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but we don\u2019t have a 2.\n\nTry using division:  \n8 \u00f7 4 = 2, then 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 \u2192 that\u2019s promising.\n\nLet\u2019s formalize:  \n(8 \u00f7 4) = 2  \n(4 \u00d7 3) = 12  \n12 \u00d7 2 = 24  \nSo: (4 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (8 \u00f7 4) = 12 \u00d7 2 = 24  \nCheck numbers used: 4, 3, 8, 4 \u2014 yes, all used exactly once.\n\nWe can write it as:  \n**4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (8 \u00f7 4)**  \nBut note: multiplication is associative, but to be safe with order of operations, parentheses help.\n\nAlternatively:  \n(8 \u00f7 4) \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 = same thing.\n\nBut let\u2019s verify:  \n8 \u00f7 4 = 2  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6  \n6 \u00d7 4 = 24 \u2705\n\nYes, that works.\n\nWe can also write:  \n8 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24  \nThat\u2019s even simpler!  \nCheck: 4 \u00f7 4 = 1  \n8 \u00d7 3 =",
