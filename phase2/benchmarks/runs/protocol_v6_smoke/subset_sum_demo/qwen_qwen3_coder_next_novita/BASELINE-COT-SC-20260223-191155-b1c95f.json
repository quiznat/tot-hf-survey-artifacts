No 9  \n- Try 3 + 6 + 8 = 17 \u2192 \u2705 Yes! 3 + 6 + 8 = 17\n\nCheck: 3 + 6 = 9, 9 + 8 = 17 \u2192 correct.\n\nAre there others? Let\u2019s verify uniqueness:\n\n- 5 + 11 = 16  \n- 5 + 11 + 3 = 19 \u2192 too big  \n- 5 + 6 + 8 = 19  \n- 11 + 6 = 17 \u2192 \u2705 Another one: 11 + 6 = 17  \nWait, 11 + 6 = 17 \u2014 yes! So two valid combinations:  \n\u2192 [3, 6, 8]  \n\u2192 [6, 11]\n\nBut the problem says \u201cselect one or more values\u201d \u2014 any valid combination is acceptable. Since multiple answers exist, we need to pick *one* valid combination.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check both:\n\n- 3 + 6 + 8 = 17 \u2714\ufe0f  \n- 6 + 11 = 17 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich to choose? Either is valid. Let\u2019s pick the shorter one: 6,11.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a restriction against order? No. Just comma-separated list.\n\nLet\u2019s ensure no duplicates or missing numbers: 6 and 11 are both in the list.\n\nSo 6,11 is valid.\n\nBut let\u2019s also consider if 17 alone? Not in list.\n\n18? Too big. 19? Too big. 22? Too big.\n\nSo only combinations are:\n\n- 6 + 11  \n- 3 + 6 + 8  \n- Any others?\n\nTry",
