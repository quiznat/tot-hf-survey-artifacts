But we have two 9s \u2014 so 21 + 9 = 30 works.\n\nCheck: 21 + 9 = 30. Yes, and we have at least one 9 in the list.\n\nSo one valid solution is: 21, 9.\n\nAre there others? Let's verify uniqueness isn\u2019t required \u2014 just any valid subset.\n\n21, 9 is valid.\n\nAlternative: 16 + 10 + 4 = 30 \u2192 16+10+4=30. Yes! That\u2019s also valid.\n\nWe have 16, 10, 4 in the list.\n\nSo two options: [21,9] or [16,10,4].\n\nWe need to pick one.\n\nEither is acceptable.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check availability:\n\nList: [1, 4, 8, 9, 9, 10, 16, 21]\n\n- 21,9: uses one 9 \u2014 OK.\n- 16,10,4: uses 16,10,4 \u2014 all present \u2014 OK.\n\nChoose one.\n\nLet\u2019s go with 16,10,4 \u2014 no duplicate needed, and all distinct.\n\nOr 21,9 is shorter.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nI\u2019ll pick 21,9.\n\nFINAL: 21,9",
