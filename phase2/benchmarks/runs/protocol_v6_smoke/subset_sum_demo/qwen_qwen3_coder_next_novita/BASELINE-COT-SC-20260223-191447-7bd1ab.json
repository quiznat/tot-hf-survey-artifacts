    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: Let's find a subset of [2, 6, 7, 21, 23, 24] that sums to 39.\n\nStart by checking combinations:\n\n- Try including 24: remaining sum needed = 39 - 24 = 15  \n  Remaining numbers: [2, 6, 7, 21, 23]  \n  Can we make 15? 2 + 6 + 7 = 15 \u2705  \n  So 24 + 2 + 6 + 7 = 39.\n\nCheck: 24 + 2 = 26, +6 = 32, +7 = 39. Yes.\n\nAlternative? Try 23: 39 - 23 = 16  \nRemaining: [2, 6, 7, 21, 24]  \nMake 16: 2 + 14? 7 + 6 + 2 = 15, +1 no. 21 too big. 16 not achievable.\n\nTry 21: 39 - 21 = 18  \nRemaining: [2, 6, 7, 23, 24]  \n18: 2 + 6 + 7 = 15, need 3 more \u2014 not possible. 24 too big. 23 too big. No.\n\nSo only valid combination is 24, 7, 6, 2.\n\nOrder doesn't matter, but typically ascending or as found. Let's sort ascending: 2,6,7,24.\n\nFINAL: 2,6,7,24",
