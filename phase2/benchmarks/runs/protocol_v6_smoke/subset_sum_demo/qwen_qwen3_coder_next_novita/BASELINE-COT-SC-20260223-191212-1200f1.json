Let\u2019s check quickly to ensure uniqueness isn\u2019t required \u2014 but the prompt says \"select one or more values\", and only one correct combination needs to be returned. Since 17+20 = 37 and both are present, that's valid.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- 19 + 18 = 37 \u2705 \u2192 also valid (two 19s exist, but we only need one 19 here; 18 is present once)\n- 19 + 14 + 4? No 4.\n- 19 + 13 + 5? No 5.\n- 14 + 13 + 10 = 37 \u2705 \u2192 14+13+10 = 37. All present.\n\nSo multiple valid combinations exist:\n- 17, 20  \n- 18, 19  \n- 10, 13, 14  \n\nThe problem says \"Select one or more values\", and asks for a comma-separated list \u2014 any one valid combination is acceptable.\n\nWe can pick any. Let\u2019s choose the simplest: two numbers: 18 and 19.\n\nWait \u2014 but there are two 19s, so using one 19 and 18 is allowed (18 is present once). Yes.\n\nAlternatively, 17+20 is also simple.\n\nLet\u2019s verify counts:\n- 17: appears once  \n- 20: once  \n\u2192 valid.\n\n18 + 19 = 37  \n- 18: once  \n- 19: twice available \u2192 using one is fine.\n\n10 +",
