    "OUTPUT: Let's find a subset of [1, 4, 8, 9, 9, 10, 16, 21] that sums to 30.\n\nTry combinations:\n\n- 21 + 9 = 30 \u2192 but we have two 9s, so 21 + 9 = 30 \u2705  \nCheck: 21 and one 9 are both in the list, and used only once.\n\nSo: 21, 9\n\nIs there any other? Let's verify uniqueness: yes, we have two 9s, so using one 9 is allowed.\n\nAlternative: 16 + 10 + 4 = 30 \u2192 16+10+4 = 30 \u2705  \nThat\u2019s also valid: 16, 10, 4\n\nAnother: 9 + 9 + 8 + 4 = 30 \u2192 9+9=18, +8=26, +4=30 \u2705  \nSo 9,9,8,4\n\nAnd: 21 + 8 + 1 = 30 \u2192 21+8+1=30 \u2705  \nSo 21,8,1\n\nAlso: 10 + 9 + 8 + 1 + ? = 28, need 2 more \u2014 no 2.\n\nBut the problem says \"Select one or more values\", and multiple solutions exist.\n\nHowever, the instruction says: \"Return only a comma-separated list of chosen numbers\" \u2014 and doesn\u2019t specify uniqueness of solution. But typically, in such problems, any valid solution is acceptable.\n\nLet\u2019s pick one valid combination.\n\nSimplest: 21 + 9 = 30 \u2192 \"21,9\"\n\nBut note: order? The example shows \"4,9,2\" \u2014 likely order doesn\u2019t matter, but usually ascending or as found.\n\nLet\u2019s sort ascending: 9,21 or 21,9 \u2014 both fine.\n\nBut to be safe, let\u2019s pick the smallest numbers? Or just any.\n\nWait \u2014 check if 21 + 9 is allowed: yes, two numbers, both in list.\n\nAlternatively, 16 + 10 + 4 = 30 \u2014 also clean.\n\nWhich to choose? Since the problem doesn\u2019t specify preference, any is fine.\n\nLet\u2019s go with 21,",
