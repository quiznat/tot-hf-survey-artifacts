    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: To form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using the digits **[2, 5, 7, 6]** exactly once, and ensuring it is **divisible by 4**, we need to recall the divisibility rule for 4:\n\n> A number is divisible by 4 **if and only if** its **last two digits** form a number divisible by 4.\n\nSo, our strategy is:\n\n1.
