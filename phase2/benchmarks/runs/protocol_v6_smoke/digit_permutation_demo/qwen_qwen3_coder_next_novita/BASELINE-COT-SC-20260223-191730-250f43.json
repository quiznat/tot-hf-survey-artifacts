    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given digits: [9, 1, 3, 8]  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using **each digit exactly once**, and the number must be **divisible by 6**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility by 6  \nA number is divisible by 6 **iff** it is divisible by both **2** and **3**.\n\n- **Divisible by 2**: the last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits from the set: **8** (only even digit).\n- **Divisible by 3**: sum of digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet\u2019s compute sum of digits:  \n9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = **21**, which is divisible by 3. \u2705  \nSo **any permutation** of these digits is divisible by 3.  \nTherefore, only need to ensure **last digit is even** \u2192 must end in **8**.\n\nSo to get the largest number, we want the **largest possible digits in the highest places**, with **8 fixed at the end**.\n\nRemaining digits to arrange in thousands, hundreds, tens places: [9, 1, 3]  \nTo maximize the number, sort them descending: **9, 3, 1**\n\nSo candidate number: **9318**\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n- Uses all digits: 9, 3, 1, 8 \u2705  \n- Ends in 8 \u2192 even \u2705  \n- Sum = 21 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2705  \n\u2192 Therefore divisible by 6 \u2705\n\nIs there a larger possible number? Let's check other permutations ending in 8:\n\nAll permutations ending in 8:\n- 9318  \n- 9138  \n- 3918  \n- 3198  \n- 1938  \n- 1398  \n\nClearly, **9318** is the largest among these.\n\n\u2705 Confirmed.\n\nFINAL: 9318",
