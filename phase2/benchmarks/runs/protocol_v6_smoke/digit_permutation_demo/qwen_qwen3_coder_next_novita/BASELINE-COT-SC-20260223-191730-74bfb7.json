    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the digits: [1, 9, 0, 8], and we must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using each digit **exactly once**, such that the number is **divisible by 6**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand divisibility by 6\nA number is divisible by 6 **if and only if** it is divisible by **both 2 and 3**.\n\n- **Divisible by 2**: The number must end in an **even digit** \u2192 last digit \u2208 {0, 8} (since only 0 and 8 are even among the digits).\n- **Divisible by 3**: The **sum of digits** must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the digit sum:  \n1 + 9 + 0 + 8 = **18**, which is divisible by 3.  \n\u2705 So **any permutation** of these digits will be divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the only constraint is that the number must end in an even digit (0 or 8), and we want the **largest possible** such number.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the largest 4-digit number using all digits, ending in 0 or 8.\n\nWe want the **largest** number, so we prefer larger digits in the higher places (thousands > hundreds > tens > units).\n\nLet\u2019s consider two cases:\n\n#### Case 1: Last digit = 8  \nRemaining digits: [1, 9, 0]  \nTo maximize the number, arrange remaining digits in descending order: 9, 1, 0  \n\u2192 Number = 9 1 0 8 = **9108**\n\n#### Case 2: Last digit = 0  \nRemaining digits: [1, 9, 8]  \nArrange in descending order: 9, 8, 1  \n\u2192 Number = 9 8 1 0 = **9810**\n\nNow compare:\n- 9810 vs 9108  \n\u2192 9810 is larger.\n\nAlso, 9810 ends in 0 \u2192 even \u2705  \nDigit sum = 9+8+1+0 = 18 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2705  \n\u2192 So divisible by 6 \u2705\n\n\u2705 Valid.\n\nIs there any larger? Let\u2019s check if any other arrangement with last digit 0 could be larger than 9",
