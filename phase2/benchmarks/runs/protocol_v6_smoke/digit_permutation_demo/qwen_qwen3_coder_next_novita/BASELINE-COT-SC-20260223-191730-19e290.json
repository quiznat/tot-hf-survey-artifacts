    "SAMPLE 10 PROMPT: Form the largest possible 4-digit integer using the provided digits exactly once.\nDigits: [6, 3, 3, 3]\nThe number must be divisible by 8.\nReturn only the integer.\n\nSample 10/10: produce an independently reasoned attempt.\nThink step by step before answering.\nEnd with exactly one line:\nFINAL: <answer>\n",
    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given digits: [6, 3, 3, 3]  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using all digits **exactly once**, and it must be **divisible by 8**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand divisibility by 8  \nA number is divisible by 8 **iff** its **last three digits** form a number divisible by 8.\n\nSo, for a 4-digit number `ABCD`, we only need to check whether `BCD` (the last three digits) is divisible by 8.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Generate all permutations of digits [6, 3, 3, 3]\n\nSince there are three 3s and one 6, the distinct permutations are limited.\n\nThe total number of distinct 4-digit numbers = 4 (positions for the 6, rest are 3s):\n\n- 6333  \n- 3633  \n- 3363  \n- 3336  \n\nLet\u2019s list them in descending order (largest first):\n\n1. **6333**  \n2. **3633**  \n3. **3363**  \n4. **3336**\n\nNow, check each for divisibility by 8 \u2014 using the last three digits.\n\n#### Check 6333:\n- Last three digits: **333**\n- Is 333 divisible by 8?  \n  8 \u00d7 41 = 328  \n  8 \u00d7 42 = 336 \u2192 too big  \n  333 \u2212 328 = 5 \u2192 remainder 5  \n  \u274c Not divisible.\n\n#### Check 3633:\n- Last three digits: **633**\n- 8 \u00d7 79 = 632  \n  633 \u2212 632 = 1 \u2192 remainder 1  \n  \u274c Not divisible.\n\n#### Check 3363:\n- Last three digits: **363**\n- 8 \u00d7 45 = 360  \n  363 \u2212 360 = 3 \u2192 remainder 3  \n  \u274c Not divisible.\n\n#### Check 3336:\n- Last three digits: **336**\n- 8 \u00d7 42 = 336 \u2192 exact!  \n  \u2705 Divisible",
