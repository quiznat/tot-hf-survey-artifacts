    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the digits: **[3, 0, 3, 0]**  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using **each digit exactly once**, and it must be **divisible by 5**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand divisibility by 5  \nA number is divisible by 5 **iff** its **last digit is 0 or 5**.  \nWe have digits: two 3s and two 0s \u2014 **no 5s**, so the only valid last digit is **0**.\n\nSo, the number must end in **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Remaining digits to arrange  \nIf we fix the last digit as 0, we have used one 0, leaving digits:  \n**[3, 3, 0]** to arrange in the first three positions (thousands, hundreds, tens).\n\nWe want the **largest possible 4-digit number**, so we want the **largest possible digits in the higher place values**.\n\nAvailable digits: 3, 3, 0  \nTo maximize the number, place the largest digits first:  \n- Thousands place: 3  \n- Hundreds place: 3  \n- Tens place: 0  \n- Units place: 0 (as required)\n\nThat gives: **3300**\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n- Uses digits: 3, 3, 0, 0 \u2014 \u2705 matches the given digits.\n- Is a 4-digit number \u2014 \u2705 (starts with 3, not 0)\n- Ends in 0 \u2014 \u2705 divisible by 5\n- Largest possible? Let\u2019s check other possibilities.\n\nOther valid endings: only 0 (since no 5), and only two 0s, so last digit must be 0.\n\nTry other arrangements ending in 0:\n\n- 3030 \u2192 smaller than 3300  \n- 3003 \u2192 ends in 3 \u2192 not divisible by 5 \u274c  \n- 0330 \u2192 not a 4-digit number (starts with 0) \u274c  \n- 0303 \u2192 same issue \u274c  \n- 0033 \u2192 same issue \u274c  \n- 3300 \u2014 only valid large candidates are 3300 and 3030.\n\n3300 > 3030, so 3300 is largest.\n\n---",
