    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the digits: [4, 2, 2, 4]  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using each digit **exactly once**, such that the number is **divisible by 11**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility Rule for 11  \nA number is divisible by 11 **iff** the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11 (including 0).  \nThat is, for a 4-digit number with digits $ a, b, c, d $ (from left to right),  \n$$\n(a + c) - (b + d) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\nEquivalently,  \n$$\n(a + c) \\equiv (b + d) \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\nSince all digits are small (0\u20139), the sums $a + c$ and $b + d$ range from 0 to 18, so the only possible differences divisible by 11 are 0 or \u00b111. But since max sum is 18 and min is 0, the difference can only be 0 or \u00b111. Let\u2019s check both.\n\nBut since total sum of all digits is $4 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 12$, and  \n$$\n(a + c) + (b + d) = 12\n$$  \nSo if $ (a + c) - (b + d) = 0 $, then $a + c = b + d = 6$.  \nIf $ (a + c) - (b + d) = 11 $, then solving with sum = 12 gives:\n- $a + c = (12 + 11)/2 = 23/2 = 11.5$ \u2192 not integer \u21d2 impossible  \nSimilarly, difference = -11 \u21d2 $a + c = 0.5$ \u21d2 impossible.\n\n\u2705 So only possible case:  \n$$\na + c = b + d = 6\n$$\n\nSo we need to partition the digits [4, 2, 2, 4] into two pairs, each summing to 6.\n\nLet\u2019s list all possible pairings:\n\n- 4 + 2 = 6  \n- 4 + 2 = 6 (using the other 4 and 2)  \nSo the",
