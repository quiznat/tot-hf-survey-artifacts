    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [4, 4, 4, 10], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle: using the numbers [4, 4, 4, 10] and basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses), reach the target 24 (or possibly another target \u2014 but since no target is specified, 24 is standard for such puzzles). Let's try to find an expression using 4, 4, 4, and 10 to make 24.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \u2192 too low\n- 10 + 4 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4/4) = ? Let's compute: 4/4 = 1",
