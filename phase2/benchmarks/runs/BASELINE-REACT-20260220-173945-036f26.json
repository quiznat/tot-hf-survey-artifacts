Let me try to find such an expression.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- 6 \u00d7 2 + 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 + 12 = 24 \u2192 works!\n- Or (6 + 6) \u00d7 (2) = 12 \u00d7 2 = 24, but that uses only three numbers.\n- Wait, need to use all four numbers: 2, 2, 6, 6.\n\nCheck: 6 \u00d7 2 + 6 \u00d7 2 = 12",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark problem using the ReAct loop. The input is [2, 2, 6, 6], and the only available tool is `calc`. This resembles a 24 game-style problem where we must use all four numbers exactly once with arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to reach 24. I previously considered 6 \u00d7 2 + 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 + 12 = 24, which uses all four numbers and evaluates correctly to 24. Let me verify this expression using the `calc` tool.\nACTION: calc 6*2 + 6*2\nFINAL: 24",
