    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 8, 1, 6] and is divisible by 8, with the oracle telling us the maximum possible such number is 5816. However, I should verify this using the tools. First, I can check if 5816 is divisible by 8 using the `is_divisible` tool. If it is, and it's the maximum permutation (since 5816 is the largest possible permutation of those digits: digits sorted descending are [8,6,5,1] \u2192 8651, but 5816 is given as oracle_max, so maybe not all permutations are valid), I need to confirm.\n\nWait \u2014 actually, the digits are [5,8,1,6], so the largest possible number is 8651, not",

I need to verify whether 5816 is divisible by 8 using the `is_divisible` tool. If yes, I should also check if any larger permutation (e.g., 8651, 8615, 8561, etc.) is divisible by 8 \u2014 but since the oracle claims 5816 is the max, perhaps no larger permutation is divisible by 8.
