    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is given as 4312, which suggests that 4312 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation of those digits and divisible by 8). Let's verify:  \n- Digits: 4,1,2,3 \u2192 possible permutations, largest is 4321, then 4312.  \n- Check divisibility by 8: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.  \n  - For 4321: last three digits = 321 \u2192 321 \u00f7 8 = 40.125 \u2192 not",

Next, check if any larger permutation (e.g., 4321) is divisible by 8: last three digits = 321 \u2192 321 \u00f7 8 = 40.125 \u2192 not divisible. So 4312 is indeed the largest valid.

To follow ReAct protocol, I should verify using the available tools. First, check if 4312 is divisible by 8 using `is_divisible`. If yes, and it's the largest permutation satisfying the condition, that's the answer. Since 4321 is larger but likely not divisible (as 321 mod 8 \u2260 0), verifying 4312 is efficient.\nACTION: is_divisible 4312",
