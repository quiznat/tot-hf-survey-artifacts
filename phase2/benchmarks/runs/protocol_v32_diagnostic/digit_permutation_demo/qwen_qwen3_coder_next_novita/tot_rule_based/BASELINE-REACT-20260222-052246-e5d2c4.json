    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 1] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9104. Let's verify if 9104 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 9104, the last three digits are 104. 104 \u00f7 8 = 13, so 104 is divisible by 8, meaning 9104 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle says 9104 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9104. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools. Let's use `is_divisible",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible number is 9104. To confirm it's valid, I need to check if 9104 is divisible by 8. As noted, divisibility by 8 depends on the last three digits: 104 \u00f7 8 = 13, so yes. But per instructions, I should use the provided tools to verify. The `is_divisible` tool likely takes a number and a divisor. So I should call `is_divisible` with 9104 and 8 to confirm. If it returns true, then 9104 is the answer. Since the oracle says it's the max, and it's valid, no need to search further.\nACTION: is_divisible 9104 8",
