    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and we are told the oracle_max is 9444. Since 9444 is the maximum possible number with those digits (digits sorted descending: 9, 4, 4, 4), we should first check if 9444 is divisible by 6. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisible by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 last digit must be 4 (only even digit available).\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 4+4+9+4 =",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 4 + 4 + 9 + 4 = 21, which is divisible by 3. So divisibility by 3 is satisfied for any permutation. For divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even \u2014 the only even digit available is 4, and we have three 4s, so any number ending in 4 is even. Therefore, any permutation ending in 4 is divisible by 6.\n\nThe largest possible number is 9444 (digits sorted descending: 9, 4, 4, 4), and it ends in 4, so it is even. Since digit sum is 21 (divisible by 3), 9444 is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 9444, which matches this. So the answer is 9444.\n\nLet\u2019s verify using",

For divisibility by 2, the number must end in an even digit \u2014 the only even digit available is 4, and 9444 ends in 4, so it is even. Therefore, 9444 is divisible by both 2 and 3, hence divisible by 6. Since it's the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending), and it satisfies divisibility by 6, it is the answer.
