    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 3, 2, 1] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max is given as 4312, which suggests that 4312 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and divisible by 11). Let's verify:  \n- 4312 \u00f7 11 = 392, and 11 \u00d7 392 = 4312 \u2192 yes, divisible.  \n- Is 4312 the largest permutation? The digits sorted descending are [4,3,2,1] \u2192 4321. But 4321 \u00f7 11 = 392.818..., not integer. Next: 4",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 4312, which is a candidate. We need to verify if it's indeed the largest permutation of [4,3,2,1] divisible by 11. The largest permutation is 4321. Let's check divisibility of permutations in descending order:  \n- 4321: 4321 \u00f7 11 = 392.818... \u2192 not divisible  \n- Next: 4312 (swap last two digits of 4321) \u2192 4312 \u00f7 11 = 392 \u2192 integer \u2192 divisible  \nSo 4312 is the largest divisible permutation. Since the oracle_max matches this, and we can confirm via is_divisible, we should verify it directly.  \nACTION: is_divisible 4312",
