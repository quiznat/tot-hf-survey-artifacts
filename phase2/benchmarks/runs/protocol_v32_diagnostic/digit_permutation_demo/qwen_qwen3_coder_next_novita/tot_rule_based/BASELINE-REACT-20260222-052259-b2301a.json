    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [1, 2, 5, 4] that is divisible by 3. The oracle_max is 5421, which is the maximum possible permutation (digits sorted descending). We need to check permutations in descending order until we find one divisible by 3.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 3: a number is divisible by 3 iff the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Sum of digits = 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 12, which is divisible by 3, so *all* permutations are divisible by 3. Therefore, the largest permutation (5421) is divisible by 3.\n\nWe can verify using is_divisible(5421, 3). But since the sum is 12, it's guaranteed.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the digits [1, 2, 5, 4] is 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, *every* permutation of these digits is divisible by 3. The largest possible permutation is formed by sorting digits in descending order: 5421, which matches the given oracle_max. So 5421 is divisible by 3 and is the maximum possible number. No further checks are needed.\nFINAL: 5421"
