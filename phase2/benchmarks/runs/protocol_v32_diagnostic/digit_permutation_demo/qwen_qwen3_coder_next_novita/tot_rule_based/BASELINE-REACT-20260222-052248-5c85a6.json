    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 9, 8, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 9888, which suggests the maximum possible number from those digits is 9888. Let's check if 9888 is divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 9888 ends in 8 \u2192 OK.\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3 \u2192 9 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 33 \u2192 33 \u00f7 3 = 11 \u2192 OK.\n\nSo 9888 is divisible by 6.
