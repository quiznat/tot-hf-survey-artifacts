    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] that is divisible by 7.

Wait \u2014 actually, the digits [4,3,9,1] can form 4391, 4319, 4931, etc. Let's sort descending: 9,4,3,1 \u2192 9431 is the largest possible number.

The oracle_max is 4319, which may or may not be the answer \u2014 we must verify using the tools. First, we should try the largest possible permutation: 9431. But since we only have tools `best_divisible` and `is_divisible`, we need to understand their usage. Likely, `best_divisible(digits, divisor)` returns the largest number formed from digits divisible by divisor, and `is_divisible(n, divisor)` checks divisibility. However, the tool signatures aren\u2019t specified, so we must infer. Since `best_divisible` is named as a tool, it probably directly solves the task \u2014 but to be safe, let\u2019s first try `best_divisible([4,3,9,1],",

The oracle_max is given as 4319, which may be the correct answer, but we must verify using the available tools. Since `best_divisible` likely returns the largest number formed from the digits divisible by the divisor, and `is_divisible` checks if a specific number is divisible, the most efficient step is to call `best_divisible` directly with the digits and divisor. This should return the desired result without needing to test permutations manually. Let's assume `best_divisible(digits, divisor)` is the intended tool to use for this task.",
