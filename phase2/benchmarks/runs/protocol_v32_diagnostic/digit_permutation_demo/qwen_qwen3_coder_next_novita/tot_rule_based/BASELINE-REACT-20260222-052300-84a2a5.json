    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [2, 4, 8, 1] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 4128. Let's verify if 4128 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 4128, the last three digits are 128. 128 \u00f7 8 = 16, so yes, 4128 is divisible by 8. Also, 4128 uses digits 4, 1, 2, 8 \u2014 exactly the given digits. So 4128 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum is 4128. I verified that 4128 uses the digits [2, 4, 8, 1] exactly once and is divisible by 8 (since 128 \u00f7 8 = 16). To confirm it's truly the maximum, I should check if any larger permutation of the digits is divisible by 8. The digits sorted descending give 8421, which is the largest possible number. Let's test the largest candidates in descending order using the is_divisible tool to ensure no larger valid number exists. But since the oracle is given and trusted (as per benchmark setup), and 4128 is valid, it's likely correct. However, to be thorough, I'll verify with best_divisible tool which is designed to find the maximum divisible number.\nACTION: best_divisible [2, 4, 8,",
