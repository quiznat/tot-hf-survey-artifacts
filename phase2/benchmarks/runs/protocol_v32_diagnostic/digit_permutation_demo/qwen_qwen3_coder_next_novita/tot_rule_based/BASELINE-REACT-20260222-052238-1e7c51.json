    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 0, 7, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum is 9750. Let's verify if 9750 is valid:  \n- Digits used: 9, 7, 5, 0 \u2014 matches the input digits.  \n- Divisibility by 6 requires divisibility by both 2 and 3.  \n  - Ends in 0 \u2192 even \u2192 divisible by 2 \u2714\ufe0f  \n  - Sum of digits: 9 + 7 + 5 + 0 = 21 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2714\ufe0f  \nSo 9750 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer is 9750. But",
