    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 5360. Let's verify if 5360 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 5360, last two digits are 60, and 60 \u00f7 4 = 15 \u2192 divisible. So 5360 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says max is 5360, and it's valid, the answer is likely 5360. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools if needed. Let's first check if 5360 is divisible by 4 using the",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible number is 5360. To confirm it's valid, I need to verify it's divisible by 4. As noted, a number is divisible by 4 iff its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 5360, last two digits are 60, and 60 \u00f7 4 = 15 (integer), so yes \u2014 5360 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer is 5360. However, to follow the ReAct protocol and ensure correctness, I should use the `is_divisible` tool to double-check divisibility of 5360 by 4 before concluding.\nACTION: is_divisible 5360 4",
