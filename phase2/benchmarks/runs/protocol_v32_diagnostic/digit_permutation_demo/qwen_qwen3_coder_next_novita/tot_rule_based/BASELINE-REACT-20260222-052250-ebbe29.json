    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number \u2264 6643 that can be formed using the digits [6, 6, 3, 4] (each used exactly once) and is divisible by 7. We have two tools: `is_divisible(n, d)` to check divisibility by d, and `best_divisible(digits, divisor, max_val)` which likely returns the largest valid number \u2264 max_val formed from digits and divisible by divisor.\n\nSince `best_divisible` directly solves the problem (given digits, divisor, and max), and we have all required inputs, we should call it directly.\n\nDigits: [6, 6, 3, 4]  \nDivisor: 7  \nOracle max: 6643  \n\nSo: ACTION: best_divisible [6, 6, 3, 4] 7 6643",
