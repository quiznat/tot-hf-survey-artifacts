    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 2] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 9420, which suggests that 9420 is the correct answer \u2014 but I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, recall: A number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n- Divisible by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 0, 2, 4.\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 15 \u2192 divisible by 3, so any permutation is divisible by 3. So only need to ensure last digit is even.\n\nTo get the largest number, try permutations",
