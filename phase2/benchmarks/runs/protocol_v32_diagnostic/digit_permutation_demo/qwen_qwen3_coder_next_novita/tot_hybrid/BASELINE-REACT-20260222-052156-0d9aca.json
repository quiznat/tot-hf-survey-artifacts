    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [1, 2, 5, 4] that is divisible by 3. The oracle_max is 5421, which is the maximum permutation of the digits, but we need to verify if it's divisible by 3. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation that is divisible by 3.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 3: a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Let's compute the sum of the digits: 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 12. Since 12 is divisible by 3, *any* permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3. Therefore, the largest permutation (i.e., the digits sorted in descending order) should be the answer.\n\nThe digits",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the digits is 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, *every* permutation of these digits is divisible by 3. The largest possible permutation is formed by sorting the digits in descending order: [5, 4, 2, 1] \u2192 5421. The oracle_max is given as 5421, which matches this. So 5421 is divisible by 3 and is the maximum possible number. We can verify with is_divisible to be safe, but logically it's guaranteed. Let's confirm with the tool to complete the benchmark properly.\nACTION: is_divisible 5421",
