    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number \u2264 1519 that can be formed using the digits [1, 1, 5, 9] (each used exactly once) and is divisible by 7. We have two tools: `is_divisible(n, d)` to check divisibility by d, and `best_divisible(digits, divisor, max_val)` which likely returns the largest number \u2264 max_val formed from digits divisible by divisor. Since `best_divisible` is directly available and matches the task, I should use it.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [1, 1, 5, 9] 7 1519",
