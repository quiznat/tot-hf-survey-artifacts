    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 6, 0] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6300. Let's verify if 6300 is valid: digits of 6300 are [6, 3, 0, 0] \u2014 matches our digits [3, 0, 6, 0] (two zeros, one 3, one 6). Now check divisibility by 6: a number divisible by 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2: last digit is 0 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits = 6 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 9 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.",
