    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 2, 3, 2] that is divisible by 6. As noted, sum of digits = 12, divisible by 3, so all permutations are divisible by 3. For divisibility by 6, we need the number to be even \u2192 last digit must be 2 (only even digit available, and we have two 2s). So we want the largest permutation ending in 2.\n\nThe largest possible number overall is 5322 (oracle_max), which ends in 2 \u2192 candidate. Let's check if it's divisible by 6 using the is_divisible tool. Since it's divisible by 3 (sum=12) and ends in 2 (even), it should be divisible by 6, but we should verify with the tool.\n\nACTION: is_div",

Since the oracle_max is 5322, and it ends in 2 (even), and digit sum is 12 (divisible by 3), it should be divisible by 6.
