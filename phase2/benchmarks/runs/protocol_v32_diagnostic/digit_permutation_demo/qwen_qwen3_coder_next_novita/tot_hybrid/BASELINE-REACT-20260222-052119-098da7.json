    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 8, 4, 6] that is divisible by 3, and we're told the oracle_max is 8664. Let's verify if 8664 is divisible by 3. Sum of digits of 8664 = 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 24, which is divisible by 3, so 8664 is divisible by 3. Also, 8664 uses digits [8, 6, 6, 4], which matches our available digits [6, 8, 4, 6] (two 6s, one 8, one 4). So 8664 is a valid candidate. Since it's the oracle_max, it's likely the correct answer. But to be thorough",
