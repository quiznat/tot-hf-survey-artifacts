    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 6, 3, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 6643, which suggests that 6643 might be the correct answer, but I need to verify it using the available tools.\n\nFirst, I should check if 6643 is divisible by 7 using the `is_divisible` tool. If it is, and it uses the digits [6,6,3,4] exactly once, then it's likely the answer. Let me verify divisibility first.\n\n6643 uses digits 6, 6, 4, 3 \u2014 which matches the input digits [6,6,3,4]. So if it's divisible by 7, it's a candidate. Let's check divisibility.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 6643, which uses digits [6,6,4,3] \u2014 exactly matching the input digits [6,6,3,4]. To confirm it's the correct answer, I need to verify two things: (1) that 6643 is divisible by 7, and (2) that no larger permutation of the digits is divisible by 7. Since 6643 is the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending: 6,6,4,3 \u2192 6643), if it's divisible by 7, it's automatically the maximum. So first, check divisibility of 6643 by 7 using `is_divisible`.\nACTION: is_divisible 6643 7",
