    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 3, 8, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and we are told the oracle_max is 8538. Let's recall: a number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 8, 8 (only even digits available are 8s).  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 any permutation is divisible by 3. So only need to ensure last digit is even (i.e., 8).  \nSo the largest possible number ending in 8",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: We need the largest permutation of [5, 3, 8, 8] ending in 8 (to satisfy divisibility by 2), and since digit sum = 24 is divisible by 3, all permutations are divisible by 3 \u2192 hence divisible by 6. To maximize the number, we want the largest possible prefix before the final 8. Remaining digits after fixing last digit as 8: [5, 3, 8]. The largest arrangement of these is 853 \u2192 so candidate is 8538. The oracle_max is given as 8538, which matches this candidate. So likely 8538 is the answer, but we should verify it's divisible by 6 using the tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 8538 6",
