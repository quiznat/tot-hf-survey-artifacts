    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by permuting the digits [2, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6525. Let's verify if 6525 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 6525 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, the digits of 6525 are [6,5,2,5], which matches the given digits [2,5,6,5] (two 5s, one 2, one 6). So 6525 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's divisible by 5, we can conclude the answer is 6525",
