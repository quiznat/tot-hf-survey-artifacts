    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [2, 4, 8, 1] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum possible such number is 4128. Let's verify if 4128 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 4128, the last three digits are 128. 128 \u00f7 8 = 16, so yes, 128 is divisible by 8. Also, 4128 uses digits 4, 1, 2, 8 \u2014 exactly the given digits. So 4128 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and we can confirm it's divisible by",
