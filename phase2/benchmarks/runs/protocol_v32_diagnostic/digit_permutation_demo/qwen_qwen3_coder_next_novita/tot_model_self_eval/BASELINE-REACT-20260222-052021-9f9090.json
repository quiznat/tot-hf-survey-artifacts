    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9636. Let's verify if 9636 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9636, the last two digits are 36, and 36 \u00f7 4 = 9, so 36 is divisible by 4. Therefore, 9636 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle_max is 9636 and it's divisible by 4, and it's the largest possible permutation of those digits (digits sorted descending: 9,6,6,3 \u2192 9663, but 9636 is",
