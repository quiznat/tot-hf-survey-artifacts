    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 9, 8, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is 9888, which is the largest possible number with those digits. We need to check divisibility by 6, which requires divisibility by both 2 and 3.\n\nDivisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 8 or 8 or 8 (all digits are 8,8,8,9 \u2192 only 8 is even, and there are three 8s, so any number ending in 8 is even).\n\nDivisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 8+9+8+8 = 33, and 33 \u00f7 3 = 11 \u2192",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 33, which is divisible by 3, so any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3. Combined with the fact that all even permutations (ending in 8) are divisible by 2, *all* permutations ending in 8 are divisible by 6. Since there are three 8s, many permutations end in 8. The largest possible number is 9888 (oracle_max), so we should first check if 9888 is divisible by 6. Since it ends in 8 (even) and digit sum is 33 (divisible by 3), it must be divisible by 6. So 9888 is a valid solution. We can confirm using is_divisible.\nACTION: is_divisible 9888 6",
