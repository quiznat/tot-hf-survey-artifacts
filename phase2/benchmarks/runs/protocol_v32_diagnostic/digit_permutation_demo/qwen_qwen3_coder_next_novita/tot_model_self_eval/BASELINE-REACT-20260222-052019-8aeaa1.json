    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 3, 7, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9732. Let's verify if 9732 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9732, the last two digits are 32, and 32 \u00f7 4 = 8, so yes, 9732 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says 9732 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9732. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools: first check if 9732 is divisible by 4 using is_divisible, and if so, that's",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible is 9732. To confirm it's valid, I need to verify it's divisible by 4. Using the divisibility rule: last two digits are 32, and 32 \u00f7 4 = 8 (no remainder), so 9732 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says it's the maximum and it satisfies the condition, the answer is 9732. However, per the ReAct loop, I should use the provided tool `is_divisible` to formally verify before concluding. Let me call `is_divisible` with 9732 and 4.\nACTION: is_divisible 9732 4",
