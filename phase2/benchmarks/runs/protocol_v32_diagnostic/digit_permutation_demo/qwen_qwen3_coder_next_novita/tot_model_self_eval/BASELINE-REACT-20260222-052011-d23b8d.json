    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9852. Let's verify if 9852 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits of 9852 are 52. 52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so 52 is divisible by 4, meaning 9852 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle_max is 9852 and it's divisible by 4, and it's the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending), then 9852 is the answer. I can confirm using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 9",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The observation says \"no\" to is_divisible 9 \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make sense, because 9 is not the number we\u2019re testing; we should be testing 9852. The tool `is_divisible` likely expects the full number as input. I misused the tool. Let me correct: test 9852 directly for divisibility by 4. Since the oracle says max is 9852, and we suspect it\u2019s divisible by 4 (last two digits 52 \u00f7 4 = 13), we should verify with `is_divisible 9852`.\nACTION: is_divisible 9852",
