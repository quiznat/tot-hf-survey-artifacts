    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 4, 9, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9840. Let's verify if 9840 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 9840, last three digits are 840. 840 \u00f7 8 = 105, so yes, 840 is divisible by 8. Also, 9840 uses digits 9, 8, 4, 0 \u2014 exactly the given digits. So 9840 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible is 9840. I need to verify if 9840 is indeed divisible by 8 and uses the given digits [0, 4, 9, 8] exactly once. Digits of 9840 are 9, 8, 4, 0 \u2014 matches the input digits. Divisibility by 8: check last three digits, 840. 840 \u00f7 8 = 105, an integer, so yes, divisible. Since it's valid and matches the oracle's claim of maximum, and no larger permutation of these digits exists (9840 is the largest possible arrangement), the answer is 9840. However, the task likely expects the number itself as the final answer, not just the first digit. Let me confirm using the tools to be thorough.\nACTION: is_div",
