    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [8, 2, 3, 1] and is divisible by 8, with the oracle indicating the maximum possible such number is 8312. I need to verify or find this using the available tools: `best_divisible` and `is_divisible`. Since `oracle_max` is given as 8312, and it's likely the correct answer, I should verify if 8312 is divisible by 8 using `is_divisible`. If it is, then that's the answer. If not, I'd need to search for the next lower permutation using `best_divisible`.\n\nFirst, check if 8312 is divisible by 8.

So 8312 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle says the maximum such number is 8312, and it satisfies divisibility, and it's the largest permutation (digits sorted descending: 8,3,2,1 \u2192 8321, but 8321 mod 8 = 1, so not divisible; next is 8312), 8312 is indeed the correct answer.
