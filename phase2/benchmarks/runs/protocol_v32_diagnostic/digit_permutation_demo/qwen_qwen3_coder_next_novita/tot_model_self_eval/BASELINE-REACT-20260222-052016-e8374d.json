    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 6, 0] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and it must be \u2264 oracle_max = 6300. Let's analyze.\n\nFirst, divisibility by 6 requires divisibility by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 0, 6 (we have two 0s and one 6).\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 3 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 9 \u2192 divisible by 3, so any permutation will satisfy divisibility by 3.\n\nSo we only need to ensure the number is even and \u2264 6300.\n\nWe want the maximum such number.\n\nAll permutations",
