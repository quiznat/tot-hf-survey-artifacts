    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 2, 0, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7, and the oracle says the maximum possible such number is 8204. Let's verify if 8204 is indeed divisible by 7 and uses all the digits.  \nFirst, check if 8204 is divisible by 7: 8204 \u00f7 7 = ?  \nCompute: 7 \u00d7 1172 = 8204? Let's verify: 7 \u00d7 1000 = 7000, 7 \u00d7 172 = 1204, so 7000 + 1204 = 8204. Yes, 7 \u00d7 1172 = 820",
