    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 5, 2, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum is 8325. Let's verify if 8325 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 8325 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, the digits of 8325 are exactly [8, 3, 2, 5], which match the given digits [8, 5, 2, 3] (just reordered). So 8325 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 8325. But to be thorough,",
