    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 2, 4, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 2443, which suggests that the maximum possible number formed by these digits is 4432, but the largest *divisible* one is claimed to be 2443. However, 2443 uses digits 2, 4, 4, 3 \u2014 which matches our digit set \u2014 so it's a candidate. Let's verify if 2443 is divisible by 7. If not, we need to search downward.\n\nBut we have two tools: `is_divisible` and `best_divisible`. Since `best_divisible` likely returns the best (largest) number directly, we should try calling it first.\n\nWait \u2014 but",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number formed by permuting digits [3, 2, 4, 4] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is 2443, which is a candidate (uses digits 2,4,4,3). However, we must verify correctness. Since we have the `best_divisible` tool, which likely computes the maximum divisible number directly, we should use it first \u2014 it's more efficient than checking permutations manually.
