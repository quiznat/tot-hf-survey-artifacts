    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 4319, which is likely the maximum possible number formed by those digits (since 4319 uses all digits and is the largest permutation: 9431? Wait \u2014 actually 9431 > 4319, so maybe oracle_max is a hint or upper bound). Let's verify: permutations of [4,3,9,1] in descending order: 9431, 9413, 9341, 9314, 9143, 9134, 4931, etc. So 9431 is the largest possible number. But oracle_max = 4319",
