    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9965. Let's verify if 9965 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 9965 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, 9965 uses digits 9, 9, 6, 5 \u2014 exactly the given digits. So 9965 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it satisfies the divisibility condition, the answer should be 9965. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools: first check if 9965",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum is 9965. To confirm, I need to verify two things: (1) 9965 uses exactly the digits [6, 9, 9, 5], and (2) it is divisible by 5. Digits of 9965 are 9, 9, 6, 5 \u2014 matches. Ends in 5, so divisible by 5. Since the oracle says it's the maximum and it's valid, no further checks needed. But per protocol, I should use the tools to verify divisibility and possibly confirm it's the best. Let's use `is_divisible` on 9965 with divisor 5 first.\nACTION: is_divisible 9965 5",
