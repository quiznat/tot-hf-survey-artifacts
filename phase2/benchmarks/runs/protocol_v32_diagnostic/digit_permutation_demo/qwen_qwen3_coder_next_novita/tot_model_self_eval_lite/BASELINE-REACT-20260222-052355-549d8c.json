    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [8, 2, 3, 1] and is divisible by 8, with the oracle indicating the maximum possible such number is 8312. I need to verify or find this using the available tools: `best_divisible` and `is_divisible`. Since `oracle_max` is given as 8312, and it's likely the correct answer, I should verify if 8312 is divisible by 8 using `is_divisible`. If it is, then that's the answer. If not, I'd need to use `best_divisible` to find the correct maximum.\n\nLet me first check if 8312 is divisible by 8. The divisibility rule for 8 is that the last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 831",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The divisibility rule for 8 states that a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 8312, the last three digits are 312. Now check if 312 \u00f7 8 = 39 \u2014 yes, exactly. So 312 is divisible by 8, meaning 8312 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle says the maximum is 8312, and it satisfies divisibility, and it's the largest permutation of [8,2,3,1] (since digits sorted descending give 8321, but 8321 is odd and not divisible by 8; next is 8312), 8312 is indeed the correct answer. I can verify with `is_divisible` to be safe, but reasoning suffices. However",
