    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9444. Let's verify if 9444 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2: last digit is 4 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits = 9 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21 \u2192 21 is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 9444 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says 9444 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9444. But to be thorough,",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible is 9444. We verified that 9444 uses the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] exactly once, ends in 4 (so divisible by 2), and digit sum is 21 (divisible by 3), hence divisible by 6. Since it's the maximum allowed by the oracle and satisfies divisibility, it must be the answer. No further checks needed.\nFINAL: 9444"
