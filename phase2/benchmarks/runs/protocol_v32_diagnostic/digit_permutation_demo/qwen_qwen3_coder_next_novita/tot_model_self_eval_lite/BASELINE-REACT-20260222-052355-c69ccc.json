    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 8, 8, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 5488, which suggests that the maximum possible number from these digits is 8854, but 5488 is likely the largest *divisible* number. Let's verify: digits are 5, 8, 8, 4 \u2014 so permutations include numbers like 8854, 8845, 8584, 8548, 8485, 8458, 5884, etc.\n\nWe need to find the largest such number divisible by 7. Since the oracle_max is 5488, that seems suspicious because 5488 uses digits 5",
