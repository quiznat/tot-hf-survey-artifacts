    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 6, 3, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 6643, which suggests that 6643 might be the correct answer, but I need to verify it using the available tools.\n\nFirst, I should check if 6643 is divisible by 7 using the `is_divisible` tool. If it is, and it uses the digits [6, 6, 3, 4], then it's likely the answer. Let me verify.\n\n6643 uses digits 6, 6, 4, 3 \u2014 which matches the given digits [6, 6, 3, 4]. So if it's divisible by 7, it's a candidate. Since it's the oracle_max",

To confirm it's the correct answer, I need to verify that 6643 is divisible by 7 using the `is_divisible` tool.
