The oracle_max is 9420, which suggests that 9420 might be the correct answer, but I need to verify it using the available tools.\n\nFirst, recall that a number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 0, 2, 4 (since digits are [9,4,0,2]).\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 15, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 any permutation is divisible by",
