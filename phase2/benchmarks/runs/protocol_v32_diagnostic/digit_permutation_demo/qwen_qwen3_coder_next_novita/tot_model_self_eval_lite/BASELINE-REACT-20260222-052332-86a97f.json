    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 3, 1, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 8315. Since the oracle_max is given, it likely represents the correct answer \u2014 but we should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, recall: a number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5. Among the digits [8, 3, 1, 5], only 5 can be the last digit to satisfy divisibility by 5 (no 0 available). So the largest possible number ending in 5 is formed by arranging the remaining digits [8, 3, 1] in descending order: 8, 3, 1 \u2192 8315. That matches oracle_max.\n\nWe can verify using `is",
