    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is given as 4312, which suggests that 4312 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum permutation divisible by 8). But I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet\u2019s check if 4312 is divisible by 8: last three digits = 312. 312 \u00f7 8 = 39 \u2192 yes, divisible.\n\nNow, is 4312 the maximum permutation? The digits are [4,1,2,3]. The largest permutation is 4321. Let\u2019s",
