    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6312. Let's verify if 6312 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 6312, the last two digits are 12, and 12 \u00f7 4 = 3, so yes, 6312 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says 6312 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 6312. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools: first check if 6312 is divisible by 4 using is_divisible, and if so",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible is 6312. To confirm, I need to verify that 6312 is divisible by 4 using the is_divisible tool. If it is, and since it's the oracle's maximum, it must be the correct answer. The divisibility rule for 4 (last two digits divisible by 4) gives 12, which is divisible by 4, but I should use the tool to be formal. Let's call is_divisible with 6312 and 4.\nACTION: is_divisible 6312 4",
