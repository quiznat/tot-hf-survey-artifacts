I should first check if any permutation of these digits forms a number that meets the criteria.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [2, 4, 8, 1], \"divisor\": 8, \"max_value\": 4128}",

However, since the digits provided are [2, 4, 8, 1] and the maximum value is 4128, I need to verify if this result is actually composed of the given digits and is indeed divisible by 8.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4128 8\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: true\nTHINK: The number 4128 is divisible by 8, as confirmed by the `is_divisible` function.
