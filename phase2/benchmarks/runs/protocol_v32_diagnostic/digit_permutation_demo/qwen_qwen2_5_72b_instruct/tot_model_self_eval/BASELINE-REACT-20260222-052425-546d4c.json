    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task requires finding the best divisible number from the given digits that can be divided by the provided divisor (6), and it should not exceed the oracle_max value (9420). To start, I will generate all possible numbers using the given digits and check which of these numbers are divisible by 6 and do not exceed 9420. However, since generating all permutations might be computationally expensive and unnecessary, I'll first try to use the `best_divisible` tool to streamline the process.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [9, 4, 0, 2], \"divisor\": 6, \"oracle_max\": 9420}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` tool has returned 9420, which means that 9420 is the largest number formed with the given digits that is divisible by 6 and does not exceed the oracle_max value. Since this is within the constraints of the problem, it is the correct answer.\n\nFINAL: 9420"
