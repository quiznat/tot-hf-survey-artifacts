    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the given digits that is divisible by the given divisor and does not exceed the oracle_max value. I will start by trying to form the largest possible number from the digits and then check if it's divisible by the divisor. If not, I will adjust downwards until I find a number that meets all criteria.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [8, 3, 1, 5], \"divisor\": 5, \"max_value\": 8315}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function has returned 8315, which is the maximum value (`oracle_max`) provided. This means either 8315 itself is divisible by 5 or it is the closest number below 8315 that is formed from the given digits and is divisible by 5. Since 8315 ends in 5, it must be divisible by 5. I should confirm this with the `is_divisible` function.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 8315, \"divisor\": 5}",
