    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to find the largest number that can be formed from the given digits [8, 9, 8, 8] which is divisible by 6 and is less than or equal to the oracle_max value of 9888. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. Since all the digits are even, any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 2. Now, I need to check if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, and then use the `best_divisible` function to find the largest number that meets the criteria.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 8+9+8+8, \"divisor\": 3}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the digits (8 + 9 + 8 + 8 = 33) is not divisible by 3, so no permutation of these digits will form a number divisible by 6. However, I should double-check my reasoning because the sum 33 is actually divisible by 3. Let me re-evaluate the possible numbers that can be formed with these digits and check them for divisibility by 6.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [8, 9, 8, 8], \"divisor\": 6, \"max_value\": 9888}",
