    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve checking for divisibility by the given divisor (8) using the digits provided. We have two tools available: `best_divisible`, which likely finds the best divisible number from the digits, and `is_divisible`, which checks if a number is divisible by the divisor. I will start by trying to find the best divisible number using the `best_divisible` tool.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 5, 6, 5], \"divisor\": 8}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` tool returned 5536, which is within the limit of `oracle_max` and is supposed to be the best number formed by the digits that is divisible by 8. However, since this is a benchmark task, it's important to verify if this number is indeed divisible by 8 using the `is_divisible` tool.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 5536, \"divisor\": 8}",
