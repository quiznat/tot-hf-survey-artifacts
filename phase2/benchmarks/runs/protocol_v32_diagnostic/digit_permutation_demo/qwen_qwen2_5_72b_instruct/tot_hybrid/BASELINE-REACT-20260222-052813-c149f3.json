    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve finding the best divisible number from a list of digits that can be divided by a given divisor. The `best_divisible` tool might help in generating the best possible number from the digits that is divisible by the divisor, and the `is_divisible` tool can check if a number is divisible by the divisor. However, it's not clear whether we need to use all the digits or just find any combination that works. Given the `oracle_max` value, it might be useful to ensure our solution does not exceed this value. Let's first try to generate the best divisible number using the `best_divisible` tool.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [5, 3, 8, 8], \"divisor\": 6}",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 8538",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` tool has returned 8538, which is equal to the `oracle_max` value provided. This means 8538 is the best number formed from the digits that is divisible by 6 and does not exceed the maximum allowed value. Since the task is to find such a number, and 8538 satisfies all conditions, we can conclude that 8538 is our final answer.\n\nFINAL: 8538"
