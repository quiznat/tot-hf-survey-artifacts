    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits [4, 4, 9, 4] which is divisible by the divisor 6 and is less than or equal to the oracle_max value 9444. To achieve this, I will first generate the largest possible number from the digits and then check if it is divisible by 6. If it is not, I will adjust the number accordingly and recheck until I find the correct answer. I'll start by forming the largest number possible.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {'digits': [4, 4, 9, 4], 'divisor': 6, 'upper_bound': 9444}",
