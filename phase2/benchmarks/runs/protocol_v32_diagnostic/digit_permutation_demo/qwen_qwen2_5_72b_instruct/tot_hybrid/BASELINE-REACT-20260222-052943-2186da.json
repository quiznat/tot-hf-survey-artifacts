    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The goal is to find the largest number composed from the given digits that is divisible by the specified divisor, and does not exceed the oracle maximum value. I can start by forming the largest possible number with the digits provided, then check if it is divisible by the divisor. If not, I will use the `best_divisible` tool to find the closest number that is divisible.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [6, 9, 9, 5], \"divisor\": 5, \"max_value\": 9965}",

However, I need to confirm if 9965 can indeed be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5].\n\nACTION: is_divisible 9965 5\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: true\nTHINK: 9965 is divisible by 5, as confirmed. Now, I need to ensure that 9965 can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5]. Given that 9965 contains the digits 9, 9, 6, and 5, it can be formed using the provided digits.\n\nFINAL: 9965"
