    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the specified divisor (6 in this case), and does not exceed the oracle_max value (9750). I will first try to form the largest possible number from the given digits and then check if it's divisible by 6. If not, I will use the available tools to find a suitable number.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [9, 0, 7, 5], \"divisor\": 6, \"max_value\": 9750}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` tool has returned 9750, which is the maximum value (`oracle_max`) we can use. To confirm that 9750 is indeed the correct answer, I need to verify if it is divisible by 6 and is formed using the provided digits. However, since the tool is specifically designed for this purpose, the result should be reliable. Nonetheless, let's double-check if 9750 is divisible by 6 as a final step.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 9750, \"divisor\": 6}",
