The `oracle_max` value 9852 might be a hint or a limit, but since it's not formed from the provided digits, I will focus on forming the largest possible number from the digits and then check if it is divisible by 4. If not, I will try the next smaller permutation.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [9, 8, 5, 2], \"divisor\": 4}",
