    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:  \n1) 5x - 6y = -42  \n2) -4x + 6y = 36  \n\nWe can solve this system using algebraic methods. Adding the two equations eliminates y:  \n(5x - 4x) + (-6y + 6y) = -42 + 36 \u2192 x = -6  \n\nSubstitute x = -6 into equation 1:  \n5(-6) - 6y = -42 \u2192 -30 - 6y = -42 \u2192 -6y = -12 \u2192 y = 2  \n\nSo solution is x = -6, y = 2.  \nWe can verify using check_xy tool.  \nAlternatively, solve2 is likely",
