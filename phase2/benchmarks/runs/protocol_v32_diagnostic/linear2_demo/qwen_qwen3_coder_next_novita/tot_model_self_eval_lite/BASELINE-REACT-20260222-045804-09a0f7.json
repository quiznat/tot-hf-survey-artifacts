    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations like ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 5x - 6y = 58  \nEquation 2: -4x + 8y = -56  \n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can use the solve2 tool, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system given the coefficients. Let me prepare the input for solve2. The tool probably expects the coefficients in a structured format \u2014 likely the same as the input: a list of equations, each with [a, b, c]. So I can pass the entire equations list to solve2.\n\nAlternatively, check_xy might be used to verify a candidate solution, but since I don\u2019t yet have a solution, solve2 is more appropriate first.\n\nLet me try",
