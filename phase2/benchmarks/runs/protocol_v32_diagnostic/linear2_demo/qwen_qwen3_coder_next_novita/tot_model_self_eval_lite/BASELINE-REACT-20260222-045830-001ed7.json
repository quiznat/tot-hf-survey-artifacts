    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [a, b, c] representing equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So the equations are:\n1) 7x + 1y = 51\n2) -7x -3y = -69\n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic methods or use the provided tools. Let me first try to use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a system of two linear equations.\n\nThe `solve2` tool probably expects the equations in a structured format. Since the input is given as a list of two equations, each with [a, b, c], I can pass the entire `equations` list to `solve2`.\n\nLet me try ACTION: solve2 [[7, 1, 51], [-7, -3,",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: x=6.000000,y=9.000000",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool successfully returned the solution x = 6.0 and y = 9.0. To verify, I can plug these values back into the original equations:\n1) 7*6 + 1*9 = 42 + 9 = 51 \u2714\ufe0f\n2) -7*6 - 3*9 = -42 - 27 = -69 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct. I can now provide the final answer.\nFINAL: x=6,y=9"
