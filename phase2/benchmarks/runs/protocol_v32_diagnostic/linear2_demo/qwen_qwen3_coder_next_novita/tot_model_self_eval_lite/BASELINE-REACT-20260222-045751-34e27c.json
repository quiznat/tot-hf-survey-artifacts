The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (presumably to solve the system). Since `solve2` is likely designed for this purpose, I should try it first. The input format for `solve2` is probably the list of equations or coefficients. Given the input structure was `[[2, 7, -30], [-6, 3, 42]]`, `solve2` likely accepts this directly. I'll call `solve2` with the equations list.  \nACTION: solve2 [[2, 7, -30], [-6, 3, 42]]",
