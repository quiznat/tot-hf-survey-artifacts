    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in two variables (x and y), represented as coefficients and constants. Each inner list [a, b, c] corresponds to the equation a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -9x + 1y = -37\nEquation 2: 8x - 6y = -8\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-equation system). Given the context, `solve2` is the appropriate tool to directly solve the system.\n\nLet\u2019s use `solve2` with the equations provided.\n\nTool input format for `solve2",

The goal is to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (to solve a 2-equation system). Since `solve2` is designed for this purpose and the input format matches (list of equations), I should call `solve2` with the equations list.\nACTION: solve2 [[-9, 1, -37], [8, -6, -8]]",

To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool by plugging x = 5 and y = 8 into both original equations:  \nEquation 1: -9x + y = -9(5) + 8 = -45 + 8 = -37 \u2714\ufe0f  \nEquation 2: 8x - 6y = 8(5) - 6(8) = 40 - 48 = -8 \u2714\ufe0f  \nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\nACTION: check_xy 5 8\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: True\nFINAL: x=5,y=8"
