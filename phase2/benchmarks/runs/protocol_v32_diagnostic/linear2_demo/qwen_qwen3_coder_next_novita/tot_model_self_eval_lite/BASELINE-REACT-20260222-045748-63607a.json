    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two quadratic equations in the form [a, b, c], representing ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0.

Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two equations, but here we have two separate equations (not a system), I should probably solve each equation individually. However, `solve2` might be designed to solve quadratic equations (since \"2\" could refer to degree 2).
