    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c.

The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-variable linear system). Since we have exactly two equations and two unknowns, `solve2` is appropriate. Let\u2019s use `solve2` with the equations.\n\nTool input for `solve2` should likely be the list of equations: [[-4, 8, -56], [9, 9, 45]].\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-4, 8, -56], [9,",
