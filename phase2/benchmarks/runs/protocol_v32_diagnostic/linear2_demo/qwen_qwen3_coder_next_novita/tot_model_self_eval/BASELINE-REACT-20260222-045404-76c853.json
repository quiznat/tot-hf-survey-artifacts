    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \nEquation 1: 6x - 7y = -18  \nEquation 2: 4x + 4y = 40  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system given coefficients. Let me try that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[6, -7, -18], [4, 4, 40]]",

To verify correctness, I should use the `check_xy` tool to plug these values back into both original equations and confirm they hold true.\n\nEquation 1: 6x - 7y = 6*4 - 7*6 = 24 - 42 = -18 \u2714\ufe0f  \nEquation 2: 4x + 4y = 4*4 + 4*6 = 16 + 24 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nVerification is straightforward, so I'll run `check_xy` with x=4, y=6.\n\nACTION: check_xy 4 6\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: Both equations are satisfied.\nFINAL: x=4, y=6"
