    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form of equations: [[-8, 7, -72], [6, -4, 44]]. This likely represents:\n- Equation 1: -8x + 7y = -72\n- Equation 2: 6x - 4y = 44\n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which is presumably designed for solving 2-variable linear systems. Let me try that first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-8, 7, -72], [6, -4, 44]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x = 2.0 and y = -8.0 as the solution to the system. To verify correctness, I should use the `check_xy` tool to plug these values back into both original equations and confirm they hold true.\n\nACTION: check_xy 2 -8\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: Equation 1: -8*(2) + 7*(-8) = -16 - 56 = -72 \u2714\ufe0f  \nEquation 2: 6*(2) - 4*(-8) = 12 + 32 = 44 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTHINK: Both equations are satisfied: Equation 1 yields -72 and Equation 2 yields 44, matching the right-hand sides. The solution x = 2, y = -8 is verified correct.\n\nFINAL: x=2,y=-8"
