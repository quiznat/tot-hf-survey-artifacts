    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n- Equation 1: -8x - 8y = 112\n- Equation 2: -2x - 9y = 77\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two linear equations with two variables, we can solve this system. Let's simplify Equation 1 first: divide both sides by -8 \u2192 x + y = -14. So x = -14 - y.\n\nSubstitute into Equation 2: -2(-14 - y) - 9y = 77 \u2192 28 + 2y - 9y = 77 \u2192 28 - 7y = 77 \u2192 -7y = 49 \u2192 y =",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the manual solution: From -7y = 49, we get y = -7. Then from x = -14 - y = -14 - (-7) = -7. So solution is x = -7, y = -7. Let's verify using the available tools to ensure correctness. We can use `check_xy` to verify the solution (x=-7, y=-7) against both equations. Alternatively, use `solve2` which likely solves a 2-equation system directly. Since `solve2` is designed for this, I'll use it with the input equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-8, -8, 112], [-2, -9, 77]]",
