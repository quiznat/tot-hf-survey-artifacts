    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations: a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -6x - y = -46\nEquation 2: -7x + 3y = -62\n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can use the solve2 tool, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. Let me check the format expected by solve2 \u2014 probably it takes the coefficients as lists.\n\nAlternatively, I could use check_xy to verify candidate solutions, but since I need to find the solution, solve2 is more appropriate.\n\nLet me call solve2 with the two equations: [[-6, -1, -46], [-7, 3, -62]].\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-6, -1, -4",
