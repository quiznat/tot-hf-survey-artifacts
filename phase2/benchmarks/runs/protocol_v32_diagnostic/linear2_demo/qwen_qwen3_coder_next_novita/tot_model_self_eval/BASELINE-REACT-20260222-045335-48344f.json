    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], which likely represents equations:  \n-7x + 3y = 87  \n-6x - 1y = 46  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which is presumably designed for solving 2-variable linear systems. Let me try that first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-7, 3, 87], [-6, -1, 46]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x = -9.0 and y = 8.0 as the solution to the system of equations. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution by plugging the values into both original equations:  \n1. -7x + 3y = -7(-9) + 3(8) = 63 + 24 = 87 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2. -6x - y = -6(-9) - 8 = 54 - 8 = 46 \u2714\ufe0f  \nBoth equations are satisfied. I can now confirm the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=-9,y=8"
