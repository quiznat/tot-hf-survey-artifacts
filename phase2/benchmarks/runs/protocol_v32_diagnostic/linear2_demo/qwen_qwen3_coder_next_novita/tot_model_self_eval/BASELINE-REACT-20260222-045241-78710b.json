    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two quadratic equations in the form [a, b, c], representing ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. So the equations are:\n1. -x\u00b2 + 6x - 16 = 0\n2. -x\u00b2 - 9x + 14 = 0\n\nWe need to solve these equations. The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a solution (x, y)) and `solve2` (probably to solve a quadratic or system). Since we have two separate quadratics, `solve2` might be designed to solve a system of two equations, but here we have two separate equations \u2014 possibly each in one variable (x), so maybe `solve2` expects two equations in two variables? Alternatively, maybe the task is to find integer solutions (x, y) that satisfy both equations if interpreted as linear in y? Wait \u2014 but the",
