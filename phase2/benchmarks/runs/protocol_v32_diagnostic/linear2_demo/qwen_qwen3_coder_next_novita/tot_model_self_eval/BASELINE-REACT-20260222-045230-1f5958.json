    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays: [[-3, 3, -3], [5, -8, -13]]. Assuming these represent linear equations in two variables x and y (e.g., ax + by = c), the first equation is -3x + 3y = -3, and the second is 5x - 8y = -13. To solve this system, I can either use algebraic methods or call the appropriate tool. Since the available tools include `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system, I should use that. I need to format the input appropriately \u2014 probably as a list of equations or coefficients. Given the structure, `solve2` likely expects the coefficient matrix and constant vector, or perhaps the full augmented matrix. Let me try passing the equations as [[-3, 3, -3], [5, -",
