    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n-5x - 7y = -16  \n-9x + 8y = -70  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system given the coefficient matrix and constants. Let me confirm the expected input format for `solve2`. Since it's not specified, I'll assume it takes the full augmented matrix or separate coefficient and constant arrays. Given the input structure matches the equations directly, `solve2` probably expects the list of equations as provided.\n\nAlternatively, I could use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions, but that would require guessing. Better to use `solve2",
