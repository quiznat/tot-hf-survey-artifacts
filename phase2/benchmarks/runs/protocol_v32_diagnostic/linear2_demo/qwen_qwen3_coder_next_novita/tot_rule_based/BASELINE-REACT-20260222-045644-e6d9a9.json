    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\n1) 6x - 2y = 8  \n2) x + 9y = 20  \n\nWe need to solve this system of two linear equations in two variables (x, y). The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a 2-equation system directly, and the input is exactly two equations, I should use `solve2` with the equations provided.\n\nTool input format for `solve2` is probably the list of equations: [[6, -2, 8], [1, 9, 20]].\n\nLet me use `solve2` with this input.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[6, -2, 8], [1, 9,",
