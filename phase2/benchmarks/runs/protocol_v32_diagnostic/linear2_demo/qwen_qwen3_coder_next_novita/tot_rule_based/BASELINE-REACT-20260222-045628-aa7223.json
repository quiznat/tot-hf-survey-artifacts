    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations given in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c. The input equations are:  \n1) -9x - 9y = -99  \n2) 9x + 3y = 45  \n\nI can simplify equation 1 by dividing by -9: x + y = 11  \nEquation 2: 9x + 3y = 45 \u2192 divide by 3: 3x + y = 15  \n\nNow subtract the simplified equation 1 (x + y = 11) from equation 2 (3x + y = 15):  \n(3x + y) - (x + y) = 15 - 11 \u2192 2x = 4 \u2192 x = 2  \nThen from x + y = 11",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From the scratchpad, I have derived that x = 2, and substituting into x + y = 11 gives y = 9. So the solution is (x, y) = (2, 9). I should verify this using the check_xy tool to ensure correctness before finalizing.\nACTION: check_xy [2, 9]",
