    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \nEquation 1: a1*x + b1*y = c1 \u2192 7x + 1y = 51  \nEquation 2: a2*x + b2*y = c2 \u2192 -7x -3y = -69  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods (e.g., substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2x2 system directly. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution. Since I don\u2019t yet have a candidate solution, `solve2` is more appropriate first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[7,",
