    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays. Each inner list likely represents an equation in the form [a, b, c] corresponding to ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -8x - y = 33  \nEquation 2: -8x - 7y = -9  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let's use algebraic elimination or substitution. Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate x:\n\n(-8x - y) - (-8x - 7y) = 33 - (-9)  \n\u2192 -8x - y + 8x + 7y = 42  \n\u2192 6y = 42 \u2192 y = 7\n\nNow plug y = 7 into Equation 1:  \n-8x - 7 = 33 \u2192 -8x = 4",

Let's verify using the second equation: -8(-0.5) - 7(7) = 4 - 49 = -45, but the RHS is -9 \u2014 inconsistency! So I made an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me recalculate:  \nEquation 1: -8x - y = 33  \nEquation 2: -8x - 7y = -9  \n\nSubtract Eq2 from Eq1:  \n(-8x - y) - (-8x - 7y) = 33 - (-9)  \n\u2192 -8x - y + 8x + 7y = 42  \n\u2192 6y = 42 \u2192 y = 7 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow plug y = 7 into Eq",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the calculation: plugging y = 7 into Equation 1: -8x - 7 = 33 \u2192 -8x = 40 \u2192 x = -5. Now verify with Equation 2: -8(-5) - 7(7) = 40 - 49 = -9, which matches the RHS. So solution is x = -5, y = 7. Let's confirm using the available tools. Since solve2 is likely designed for solving 2-variable linear systems, I'll use that.\nACTION: solve2 [[-8, -1, 33], [-8, -7, -9]]",
