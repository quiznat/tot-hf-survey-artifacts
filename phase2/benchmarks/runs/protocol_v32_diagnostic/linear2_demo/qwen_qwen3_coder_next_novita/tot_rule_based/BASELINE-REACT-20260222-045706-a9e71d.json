    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1. -4x + 8y = -56\n2. 9x + 9y = 45\n\nWe need to solve this system for x and y. Let's simplify each equation first.\n\nEquation 1: -4x + 8y = -56 \u2192 divide both sides by -4: x - 2y = 14 \u2192 x = 2y + 14  \nEquation 2: 9x + 9y = 45 \u2192 divide both sides by 9: x + y = 5 \u2192 x = 5 - y\n\nNow set the two expressions for x equal:  \n2y + 14 = 5 - y  \n\u2192 2y + y =",

Let's use `check_xy` to validate (x=8, y=-3) against both equations.\n\nFirst, format input for `check_xy`: likely expects x and y values. Since the tool name suggests checking a pair, we'll try `check_xy(8, -3)`.\n\nAlternatively, `solve2",
