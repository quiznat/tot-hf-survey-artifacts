    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. We have two equations:  \n1) 7x + 7y = 42  \n2) -5x + 9y = 82  \n\nWe need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a system of two linear equations). Since `solve2` is designed for solving two equations, it's the appropriate first step.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[7, 7, 42], [-5, 9, 82]]",

To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool with the original equations: 7x + 7y = 42 and -5x + 9y = 82.
