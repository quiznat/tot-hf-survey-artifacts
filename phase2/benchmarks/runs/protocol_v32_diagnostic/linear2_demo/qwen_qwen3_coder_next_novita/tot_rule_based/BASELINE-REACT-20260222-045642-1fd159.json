The `solve2` tool is designed for solving 2\u00d72 linear systems, and the input format appears to match the given structure: each equation as [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So we can directly pass the list of equations to `solve2`. Let's use that tool now.  \nACTION: solve2 [[-8, -3, -66], [1, -8, -42]]",
