    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input contains two equations represented as coefficient arrays: [-9, 7, 15] and [-2, 0, 8]. Typically, such arrays represent linear equations in the form ax + by = c. So:\n- First equation: -9x + 7y = 15\n- Second equation: -2x + 0y = 8 \u2192 -2x = 8 \u2192 x = -4\n\nWe can solve this system manually or use the available tools. Since `solve2` is likely designed for solving 2-variable linear systems, and we have exactly two equations, `solve2` is appropriate. Let's use `solve2` with the equations.\n\nBut first, confirm format: `solve2` probably expects equations in standard form (a, b, c) for ax + by = c. Our input matches that.\n\nSo ACTION: solve2 [[-9,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool successfully solved the system and returned x = -4.000000, y = -3.000000. Let's verify this solution using the original equations:\n- First equation: -9x + 7y = -9(-4) + 7(-3) = 36 - 21 = 15 \u2713\n- Second equation: -2x + 0y = -2(-4) = 8 \u2713\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct. The final answer is x = -4, y = -3.\n\nFINAL: x=-4,y=-3"
