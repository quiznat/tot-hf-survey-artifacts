    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations.

I can either use algebraic methods or call the available tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2\u00d72 linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the coefficient matrix and constants \u2014 possibly as [[-1, 2], [3, -5]] and constants [-15, 41], or maybe as the full augmented rows. Since the tool name is `solve2`, and the input is given as two equations with three numbers each (coefficients + constant),",

Since `solve2` is designed for 2-variable systems and the input matches the expected format (two equations, each with [coeff_x, coeff_y, constant]), I should call `solve2` directly with the full equations list.  \nACTION: solve2 [[-1, 2, -15], [3, -5, 41]]",
