    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [a, b, c] representing equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\n- Equation 1: -5x + 6y = 33\n- Equation 2: -4x - 7y = 50\n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which is likely designed to solve a system of two linear equations. Let me try that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-5, 6, 33], [-4, -7, 50]]",
