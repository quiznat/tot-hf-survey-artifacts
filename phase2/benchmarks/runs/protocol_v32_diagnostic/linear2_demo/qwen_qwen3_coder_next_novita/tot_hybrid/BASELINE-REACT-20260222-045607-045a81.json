    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c], representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n1) 7x + 1y = 51\n2) -7x - 3y = -69\n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic substitution/elimination or use the provided tools. Let's consider using solve2, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system. The input format for solve2 might expect the coefficients as a list of equations, i.e., [[7,1,51],[-7,-3,-69]], which matches the input. So I'll try ACTION: solve2 [[7,1,51],[-7,-3,-69]].\n\nBut first, let me verify if I should use check_xy instead \u2014 but check_xy probably checks a proposed (x",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The scratchpad shows that after using solve2, the solution is x=6.000000, y=9.000000. Let me verify this by plugging into both equations:\n1) 7x + y = 7*6 + 9 = 42 + 9 = 51 \u2714\ufe0f\n2) -7x - 3y = -7*6 - 3*9 = -42 - 27 = -69 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct. I can now provide the final answer.\nFINAL: x=6,y=9"
