    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:  \n1) -5x - 5y = 15  \n2) 8x + 7y = -20  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve the system. Let's simplify the first equation: divide both sides by -5 \u2192 x + y = -3 \u2192 y = -3 - x. Substitute into second equation:  \n8x + 7(-3 - x) = -20  \n8x -21 -7x = -20  \nx -21 = -20  \nx = 1  \nThen y = -3 - 1 = -4. So solution is (x=1, y=-4).  \n\nWe can verify using check",
