    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -6x - y = -46\nEquation 2: -7x + 3y = -62\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic substitution/elimination manually, or use the available tools. Let's consider using solve2, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. The input format for solve2 is probably the coefficients and constants \u2014 possibly as a list of equations or a matrix. Given the input format matches [a, b, c], I can pass the list of equations directly to solve2.\n\nLet me try ACTION: solve2 [[-6, -1, -46], [-7, 3, -62]]\n\nBut first, double-check: is solve2 expecting",
