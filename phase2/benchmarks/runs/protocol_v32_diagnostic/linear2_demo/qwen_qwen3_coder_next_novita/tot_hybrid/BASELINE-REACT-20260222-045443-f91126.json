    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations like a*x + b*y = c or similar. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two equations, and we have two equations, I should use `solve2` to find the solution (x, y). Let me try calling `solve2` with the list of equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[9, 6, 48], [-7, 5, 40]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned the solution x=0.000000, y=8.000000. Let me verify this by plugging into the equations:  \nFirst equation: 9*x + 6*y = 9*0 + 6*8 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f  \nSecond equation: -7*x + 5*y = -7*0 + 5*8 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nBoth equations are satisfied. The solution is correct.\n\nFINAL: x=0, y=8"
