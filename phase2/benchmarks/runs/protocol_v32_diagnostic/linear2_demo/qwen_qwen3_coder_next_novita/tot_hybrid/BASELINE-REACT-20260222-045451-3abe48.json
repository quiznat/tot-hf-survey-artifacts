    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays. Each inner list likely represents an equation of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -8x - y = 33  \nEquation 2: -8x -7y = -9  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since both equations have the same coefficient for x (-8), subtracting them may eliminate x. Let's compute manually first to verify.\n\nSubtract Eq2 from Eq1:  \n(-8x - y) - (-8x -7y) = 33 - (-9)  \n\u2192 -8x - y + 8x + 7y = 42  \n\u2192 6y = 42 \u2192 y = 7\n\nPlug y = 7 into Eq1:  \n-8x - 7 = 33 \u2192 -8x =",

To confirm correctness, we should verify using the available tools. The `check_xy` tool can validate the solution, and `solve2` might directly solve the system. Since we already have the solution, using `check_xy` with x=-5, y=7 is efficient to verify both equations.  \n\nACTION: check_xy -5 7",
