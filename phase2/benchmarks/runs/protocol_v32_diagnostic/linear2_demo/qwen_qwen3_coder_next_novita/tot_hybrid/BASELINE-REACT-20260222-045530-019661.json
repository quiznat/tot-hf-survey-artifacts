    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations like a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) -8x - 8y = 112  \n2) -2x - 9y = 77  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two linear equations with two variables, we can solve this system. Let's try to simplify the first equation: divide both sides by -8 \u2192 x + y = -14. So equation (1) becomes x + y = -14 \u2192 x = -14 - y.\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):  \n-2(-14 - y) - 9y = 77  \n\u2192 28 + 2y - 9y = 77  \n\u2192 28 - 7y = 77  \n\u2192 -",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: We have manually solved the system and verified the solution (x = -7, y = -7) satisfies both equations. Now, to complete the benchmark task, we should use one of the available tools. Since `check_xy` likely verifies a proposed solution, and we have a candidate solution, we can use `check_xy` to confirm correctness. Alternatively, `solve2` might compute the solution directly, but since we already have it, verification is sufficient and efficient.
