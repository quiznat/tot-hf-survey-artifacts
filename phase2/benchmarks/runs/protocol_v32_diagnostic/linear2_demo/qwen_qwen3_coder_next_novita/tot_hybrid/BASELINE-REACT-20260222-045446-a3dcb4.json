So the equations are:\n-7x + 3y = -30  \n-4x - 5y = 3  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two equations, that seems appropriate here. Let's use `solve2` with the equations.\n\nThe input format for `solve2` is probably the list of equations as given: [[-7, 3, -30], [-4, -5, 3]].\n\nSo I'll call `solve2` with that input.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-7, 3, -30], [-4, -5, 3]]",

To verify correctness, I should use `check_xy` to plug these values back into the original equations and confirm they satisfy both.\n\nOriginal equations:\n1) -7x + 3y = -30  \n2) -4x - 5y = 3  \n\nPlug in x = 3, y = -3:\n1) -7(3) + 3(-3) = -21 - 9 = -30 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) -4(3) - 5(-3) = -12 + 15 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\n\nACTION: check_xy 3 -3\nFINAL: x=3,y=-3"
