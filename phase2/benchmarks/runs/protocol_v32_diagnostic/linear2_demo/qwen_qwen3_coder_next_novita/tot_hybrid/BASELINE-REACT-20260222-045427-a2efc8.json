    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of two equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c. So we have:\n1) 4x + 9y = -9  \n2) 9x - y = 86  \n\nWe need to solve this system of two linear equations for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a 2x2 system directly, and the input format matches two equations, I should use `solve2` with the list of equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[4, 9, -9], [9, -1, 86]]",

To verify correctness, I should use `check_xy` to confirm that these values satisfy both original equations:  \n1) 4x + 9y = 4*9 + 9*(-5) = 36 - 45 = -9 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) 9x - y = 9*9 - (-5) = 81 + 5 = 86 \u2714\ufe0f  \nUsing `check_xy` will validate this solution.\n\nACTION: check_xy 9 -5\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: True\nTHINK: The `check_xy` tool confirmed that x = 9 and y = -5 satisfy both equations. The solution is verified and correct.\n\nFINAL: x=9,y=-5"
