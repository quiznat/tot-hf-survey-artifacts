    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\n1) 6x + 1y = 28  \n2) 8x + 6y = 0  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve this system. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-equation system). Given that `solve2` is directly for solving 2 equations, it's the most appropriate first step.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[6, 1, 28], [8, 6, 0]]",
