    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -7x + 3y = 87  \nEquation 2: -6x - 1y = 46  \n\nWe need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let's consider using the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution. Since we don\u2019t yet have a solution, `solve2` is more appropriate.\n\nLet me try calling `solve2` with the equations. The tool likely expects the equations in a structured format \u2014 perhaps as a list of two equations",
