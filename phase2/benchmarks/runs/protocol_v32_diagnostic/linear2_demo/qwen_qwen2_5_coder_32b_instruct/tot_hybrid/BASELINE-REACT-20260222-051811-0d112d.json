    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables.

I should use the solve2 tool to solve these systems.\n\nLooking at the first system: [1, -8, -29] represents x + (-8)y = -29, but this doesn't match the format I expect. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the format, it seems like each list contains [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c.
