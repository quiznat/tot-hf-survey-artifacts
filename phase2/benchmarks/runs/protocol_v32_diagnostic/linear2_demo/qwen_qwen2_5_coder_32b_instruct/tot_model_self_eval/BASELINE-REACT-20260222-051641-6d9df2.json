    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task using the available tools. The task provides two equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. I have two tools available: check_xy which likely verifies solutions, and solve2 which probably solves systems of two linear equations. \n\nSince I have two equations with two variables (x and y), I should use the solve2 tool to find the solution. The equations are:\n-9x + 7y = 15\n-2x + 0y = 8\n\nLet me use the solve2 tool with the given equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-9, 7, 15], [-2, 0, 8]]\n\nFINAL: The solution to the system of equations is x = -4, y = -3. This can be verified by substituting back into both original equations:\n-9(-4) + 7"
