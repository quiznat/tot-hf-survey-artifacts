    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what operations to perform. The equations are presented as lists of three numbers each. Looking at the format, this appears to be a system of linear equations in two variables (x and y), where each list represents coefficients and constant term for an equation.\n\nFor example:\n- [-4, 8, -56] likely represents: -4x + 8y = -56\n- [9, 9, 45] likely represents: 9x + 9y = 45\n\nI should use the solve2 tool to solve this system of equations. This tool is designed to handle systems of two linear equations with two unknowns.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-4, 8, -56], [9, 9, 45]]",
