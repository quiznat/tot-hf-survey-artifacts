The given equations can be written as:\n1) -4x - y = 24\n2) -6x - 6y = 0\n\nThe available tools suggest that 'solve2' might be used to directly solve for x and y, while 'check_xy' could be used to verify the solution. I will use the 'solve2' tool with the coefficients provided.\n\nACTION: solve2 -4 -1 24 -6 -6 0",

Before concluding, it's a good practice to verify this solution by substituting these values back into the original equations or using the 'check_xy' tool.\n\nACTION: check_xy -4 -1 24 -6 -6 0 -8 8\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: True\nTHINK: The solution (x = -8, y = 8) satisfies both equations, as confirmed by the 'check_xy' tool.
