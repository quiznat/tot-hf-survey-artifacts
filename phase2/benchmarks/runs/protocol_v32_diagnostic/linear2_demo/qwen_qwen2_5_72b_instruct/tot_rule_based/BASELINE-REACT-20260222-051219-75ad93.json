    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. Each sublist in the 'equations' list represents an equation where the last element is the constant term and the preceding elements are the coefficients of the variables. I need to use the available tools to solve this system of equations.\n\nFor example, the first equation is -5x - 7y = -16 and the second equation is -9x + 8y = -70. To find the values of x and y, I should use the `solve2` tool which is designed to solve systems of two linear equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-5, -7, -16] [-9, 8, -70]",
