    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of equations in matrix form. Each sublist represents an equation where the first two elements are the coefficients of x and y, and the third element is the constant. We have two equations with two unknowns which can be solved using linear algebra or substitution/elimination methods. Since we have the 'solve2' tool available, it's best to use this tool to find the solution for x and y directly.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-9, 7, 15] [-2, 0, 8]",
