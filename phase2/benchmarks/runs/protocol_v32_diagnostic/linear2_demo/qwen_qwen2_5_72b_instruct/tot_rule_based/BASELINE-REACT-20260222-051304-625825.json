    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve solving a system of equations. The given equations can be represented as \\(x^y = 36\\) and \\(y^x = 18\\), where the first equation has the base 4 and exponent 2 resulting in 36, and the second equation has the base 2 and exponent 4 resulting in 18. However, this interpretation does not seem to fit well because \\(4^2 = 16\\) and \\(2^4 = 16\\), not 36 and 18 respectively. I need to clarify the representation of the equations before proceeding.\n\nGiven the structure of the input, it appears that each list represents an equation in the form of \\(a^b = c\\).
