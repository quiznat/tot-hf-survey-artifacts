The equations can be represented as follows:\n1) -5x + 7y = -41\n2) 5x + 7y = -1\n\nThe available tools include `check_xy` which likely checks a solution (x, y) against the equations, and `solve2` which is probably designed to solve a system of two linear equations.\n\nSince I have a clear set of two linear equations, the most direct approach would be to use `solve2` to find the values of x and y.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-5, 7, -41] [5, 7, -1]",
