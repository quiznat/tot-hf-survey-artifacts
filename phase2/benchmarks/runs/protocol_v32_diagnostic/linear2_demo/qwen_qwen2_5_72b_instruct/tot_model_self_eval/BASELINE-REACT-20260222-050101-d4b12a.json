    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task involves solving a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. The task input is a list of equations where each equation is a list containing the coefficients of the variables and the constant term. The available tools are `check_xy` which likely checks if a solution (x, y) satisfies the equations, and `solve2` which is probably used to solve a system of two linear equations with two unknowns. I should use `solve2` to find the solution (x, y) for the given system of equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-5, -7, -16] [-9, 8, -70]",
