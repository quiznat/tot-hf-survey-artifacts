    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a system of linear equations. The equations given are in the form of [a, b, c] where ax + by = c. The available tools are 'check_xy' which likely checks if a solution (x, y) satisfies both equations, and 'solve2' which is probably used to find the solution (x, y) for the system of equations. Since we need to find the solution first before checking it, I will use the 'solve2' tool with the provided equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-1, 2, -15] [3, -5, 41]",
