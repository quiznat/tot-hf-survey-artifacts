    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. The provided input is a list of coefficients for two equations in the form of [a, b, c] where 'a' and 'b' are the coefficients of x and y, respectively, and 'c' is the constant term. The equations can be written as:\n\n-9x + 7y = 15\n-2x + 0y = 8\n\nGiven the available tools, `check_xy` likely checks if the solution (x, y) satisfies the equations, while `solve2` is probably designed to solve systems of two linear equations. I should use `solve2` with the given coefficients to find the values of x and y.\n\nACTION: solve2 -9 7 15 -2 0 8",
