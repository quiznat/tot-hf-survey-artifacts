    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target value of 57 using the numbers [5, 14, 19, 19, 19]. I can use the `sum_list` tool to compute the sum of any subset of these numbers, and `check_target` to verify if a given list sums to the target. First, I should try summing all numbers to see what we get.  \nLet\u2019s compute the sum of all numbers: 5 + 14 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 76. That's too high.  \nWe need exactly 57. Let\u2019s try combinations. Since 19 appears three times, maybe using two 19s (38) plus something: 57 - 38 = 19 \u2014 but that would require a third 19, giving 57 = 19+19+19 = 57. Wait \u2014 that\u2019s exactly 57! And we have three 19s available. So [19, 19, 19] sums to 57. Let me verify using `sum_list`.  \nACTION: sum_list [19, 19, 19]",
