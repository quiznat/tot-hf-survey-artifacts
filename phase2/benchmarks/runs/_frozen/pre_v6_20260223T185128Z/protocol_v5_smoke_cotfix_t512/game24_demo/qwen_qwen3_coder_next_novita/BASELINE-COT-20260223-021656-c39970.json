    "OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [3, 4, 4, 8], and we must use each **exactly once** to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s try to think of combinations that yield 24.\n\nSome known facts:\n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, so if we can make the other two numbers (4 and 4) cancel out or become 1 (e.g., via division or subtraction), that might work.\n- 4 + 4 = 8, and 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 but then we\u2019d have used 4, 4, 3, but not 8 \u2014 wait, we have an 8 already. So 8 (given) + (4 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 8 + 24 = 32 \u2014 too big.\n- Try (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but we don\u2019t have 2.\n- Try (8 \u00f7 (4 \u2212 3)) \u00d7 4 = (8 \u00f7 1) \u00d7 4 = 32 \u2014 too big.\n- Try (8 \u00d7 4) \u2212 (4 \u00d7 3) = 32 \u2212 12 = 20 \u2014 no.\n- Try (8 + 4) \u00d7 (4 \u2212 3) = 12 \u00d7 1 = 12 \u2014 no.\n- Try 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4) = 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 wait, that uses three 4s: 4, 4, 4 \u2014 but we only have two 4s. So not valid.\n\nWait: 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4) uses three 4s \u2014 invalid.\n\nTry: (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (3 + 3) \u2014 but only one 3.\n\nTry: (4 \u00d7 4) + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24 \u2014 then we need to use 3 \u2014 but we haven\u2019t used 3 yet. So need to incorporate 3 in a neutral way: e.g., \u00d7 (3/3) = 1, but we only have one 3.\n\nHmm.\n\nTry: (8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24 \u2014 yes! That uses",
