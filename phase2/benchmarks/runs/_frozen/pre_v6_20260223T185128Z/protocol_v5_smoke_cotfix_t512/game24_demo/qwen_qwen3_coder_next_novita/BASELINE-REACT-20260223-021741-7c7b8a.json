    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [6, 4, 10, 4]. The available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since no specific operation is given, the most common benchmark task with such input is to compute the sum, average, or perhaps to form an expression (e.g., using all numbers once with operations to reach a target \u2014 but no target is given). Given the simplicity and typical benchmark patterns, the most likely intent is to compute the sum.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the sum: 6 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24.\n\nI\u2019ll use the `calc` tool to verify.\n\nACTION: calc 6 + 4 + 10 + 4",
