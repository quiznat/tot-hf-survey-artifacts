Then we\u2019d need to use the two 4s to produce 1 (so that multiplying by 1 doesn\u2019t change it), or combine them to make something that fits.\n\n- 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 \u2192 remaining 4 and 4. Can we make them cancel out? Like (4 \u2212 4) = 0, but 24 + 0 = 24, but then we\u2019d be adding, not using multiplication directly. But expression would be (3 \u00d7 8) + (4 \u2212 4) = 24 + 0 = 24. That uses all numbers exactly once.\n\nCheck: 3 \u00d7 8 + (4 \u2212 4) = 24 + 0 = 24 \u2705\n\nBut is that acceptable? Yes \u2014 standard 24 game allows +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses.\n\nAlternative: (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but we don\u2019t have 2.\n\nAnother idea: 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4) = 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24.
