    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [2, 10, 10, 3], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, I need to infer what to compute. Common benchmark tasks with a list of numbers include computing the sum, product, average, or perhaps evaluating an expression like 2 + 10 * 10 - 3 or similar. Given the numbers and typical precedence, maybe it's evaluating an expression in order: 2 + 10 + 10 + 3 = 25, or 2 * 10 * 10 * 3 = 600, or perhaps following standard order of operations if it's meant as an expression like 2 + 10 * 10 / 3, but that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a puzzle like \"2 10 10 3\" meaning something like 2^(10) - 10^3 = 1024 - 1000 = 24, or 2*10 + 10*3 = 20 + 30 = 50, etc.\n\nBut since the only tool is `calc`, and no explicit instruction is given, the safest assumption is to compute the sum, as that's the most basic operation for a list of numbers.\n\nLet me try computing the sum: 2 + 10 + 10 + 3 = 25.\n\nI'll use the `calc` tool to compute that.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 10 + 10 + 3",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 25",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the numbers [2, 10, 10, 3] is 25, as confirmed by the `calc` tool. However, benchmark tasks with number lists sometimes expect other operations\u2014like product, average, or a specific expression. Since no explicit instruction is given, and sum is the most straightforward, but to be thorough, I should consider if other common interpretations exist. For example:\n- Product: 2 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 3 = 600\n- Average: 25 / 4 = 6.25\n- Expression in order: 2 + 10 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 = 2 + 100 \u2212 3 = 99 (if following standard precedence)\nBut without context, sum is the most neutral and common baseline. Since the tool returned 25 for the sum, and no contradiction or further instruction appears, I'll conclude the answer is 25.\n\nFINAL: 25"
