    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 3, 3, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 3336. Let\u2019s recall the divisibility rule for 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nWe have digits: 6, 3, 3, 3 \u2014 so only one 6 and three 3s. The largest possible number is 6333, then 3633, 3363, 3336. Let's check these in descending order.\n\nCheck 6336? Wait \u2014 we only have one 6, so 6336 would need two 6s \u2014 not allowed. So possible permutations (descending order):\n\n- 6333  \n- 3633  \n- 3363  \n- 3336  \n\nWe\u2019re told oracle_max = 3336, which suggests 3336 is the correct answer \u2014 but let\u2019s verify.\n\nCheck divisibility by 8:\n\n- 6333: last three digits = 333 \u2192 333 \u00f7 8 = 41.625 \u2192 not divisible  \n- 3633: last three digits = 633 \u2192 633 \u00f7 8 = 79.125 \u2192 not divisible  \n- 3363: last three digits = 363 \u2192 363 \u00f7 8 = 45.375 \u2192 not divisible  \n- 3336: last three digits = 336 \u2192 336 \u00f7 8 = 42 \u2192 divisible!\n\nSo 3336 is divisible by 8, and it's the largest among the permutations that satisfies the condition.\n\nWe can use `is_divisible` to verify 3336 % 8 == 0.\n\nBut the task likely expects us to find the max divisible number using the tools. Since `best_divisible` likely returns the largest number formed from digits divisible by divisor, maybe we can call it directly.\n\nLet\u2019s try ACTION: best_divisible with digits [6,3,3,3] and divisor 8.\n\nBut need to format input",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 3336",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The scratchpad analysis shows that among all permutations of [6,3,3,3], 3336 is the largest divisible by 8 (since 336 \u00f7 8 = 42). The oracle_max confirms this. To complete the task, we should verify using the available tools. Since `best_divisible` likely returns the maximum valid number directly, and the input format is digits and divisor, I'll call it with [6,3,3,3] and 8.\nACTION: best_divisible [6, 3, 3, 3] 8",
