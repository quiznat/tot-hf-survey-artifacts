    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [1, 9, 0, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 9810, which suggests that 9810 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify it using the tools.\n\nFirst, recall: A number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n- Divisible by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 0, 8 (since digits are [1,9,0,8]).\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 1+9+0+8 = 18, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 any permutation is divisible by 3.\n\nSo only need to ensure last digit is even (0 or 8), and maximize the number.\n\nTo maximize, try descending order with even digit at end:\n- Try 9810 (ends with 0) \u2192 candidate.\n- Next: 9801 (ends with 1 \u2192 odd, reject)\n- 9180 (ends with 0) \u2192 smaller than 9810\n- 9108 (ends with 8) \u2192 smaller\n- 9018 (ends with 8) \u2192 smaller\n- 8910 (ends with 0) \u2192 smaller\nSo 9810 is likely the max.\n\nLet\u2019s verify using tools:\n1. Check if 9810 is divisible by 6 using is_divisible.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 9810 6",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: yes"
