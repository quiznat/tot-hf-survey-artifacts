    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number \u2264 oracle_max (3300) that is divisible by the given divisor (5), using only the digits [3, 0, 3, 0] \u2014 i.e., permutations of these digits to form a number. So we need to consider all permutations of [3,0,3,0] to form 4-digit numbers (allowing leading zeros? But numbers with leading zeros would be less than 1000, and oracle_max is 3300, so likely we want the largest valid number \u2264 3300 formed by permuting digits). Let's list all distinct permutations of [3,0,3,0]:\n\nDigits: two 3s and two 0s.\n\nPermutations (as numbers, ignoring leading zeros \u2014 but leading zeros would make it a shorter number, e.g., 0033 = 33, but we can consider them as numbers, not strings):\n\nAll unique permutations:\n- 3300\n- 3030\n- 3003\n- 0330 = 330\n- 0303 = 303\n- 0033 = 33\n\nSo candidate numbers: 3300, 3030, 3003, 330, 303, 33.\n\nNow check which are divisible by 5: a number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5. Our digits are only 0 and 3, so only numbers ending in 0 qualify.\n\nFrom list:\n- 3300 \u2192 ends with 0 \u2192 divisible by 5? 3300 / 5 = 660 \u2192 yes.\n- 3030 \u2192 ends with 0 \u2192 3030 / 5 = 606 \u2192 yes.\n- 3003 \u2192 ends with 3 \u2192 no.\n- 330 \u2192 ends with 0 \u2192 330 / 5 = 66 \u2192 yes.\n- 303 \u2192 ends with 3 \u2192 no.\n- 33 \u2192 ends with 3 \u2192 no.\n\nNow among those divisible by 5: 3300, 3030, 330.\n\nWe need the largest \u2264 oracle_max = 33"
