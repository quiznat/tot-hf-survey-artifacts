    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [9, 1, 3, 8] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 9318, which suggests that 9318 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and divisible by 6). But I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, recall: A number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n- Divisible by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 8 (only even digit in [9,1,3,8]).\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9+1+3+8 = 21, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 all permutations are divisible by 3.\nSo only need to ensure last digit is 8.\n\nThus, the largest permutation ending in 8 is formed by sorting remaining digits [9,1,3] in descending order: 9,3,1,8 \u2192 9318.\n\nLet\u2019s verify using tools:\n1. Check if 9318 is divisible by 6 using `is_divisible`.\n2. If yes, that\u2019s the answer (since it\u2019s the largest possible permutation ending in 8, and all permutations are divisible by 3).\n\nACTION: is_divisible 9318 6",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: yes"
