    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [2, 5, 7, 6] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum is 7652. Let's verify if 7652 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 7652, the last two digits are 52. 52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so 52 is divisible by 4. So 7652 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 7652. But to be thorough, maybe I should confirm using the tools. Let's use `is_divisible` to check 7652 \u00f7 4. Alternatively, `best_divisible` might directly give the answer. Since the oracle gives the max, and it's plausible, but let's verify with tools as per ReAct. I'll use `is_divisible` with number 7652 and divisor 4.\nACTION: is_divisible 7652 4",
