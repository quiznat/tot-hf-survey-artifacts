    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [a, b, c] representing equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -8x - 9y = -82  \nEquation 2: 7x - 7y = 42  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a system of two linear equations given their coefficients. Let me prepare the input for `solve2`. Since `solve2` probably expects the coefficients in a structured way, and the input is given as a list of two equations, each with [a, b, c], I can pass the entire `equations` list to `solve2`.\n\nAlternatively, I could use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions, but since I don\u2019t have a candidate yet, `solve2` is more appropriate.\n\nLet me call `solve2` with the equations list.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-8, -9, -82], [7, -7, 42]]",
