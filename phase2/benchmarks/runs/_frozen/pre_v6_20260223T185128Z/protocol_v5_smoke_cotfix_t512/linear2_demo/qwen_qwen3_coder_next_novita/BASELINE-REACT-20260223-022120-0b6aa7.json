    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \na1*x + b1*y = c1  \na2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nSo here:  \nEquation 1: 5x + 1y = 45  \nEquation 2: -9x + (-7)y = -107 \u2192 -9x - 7y = -107  \n\nWe need to find x and y satisfying both. Let's try solving manually first, or use the available tools.  \nTool `solve2` likely solves a 2x2 system directly. Let's use it.  \nTool `check_xy` can verify a candidate solution (x, y) against both equations.\n\nFirst, try `solve2` with the equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[5, 1, 45], [-9, -7, -107]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x = 8.0 and y = 5.0 as the solution. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool with both equations. Let's plug in x=8, y=5 into the original equations:  \nEquation 1: 5*8 + 1*5 = 40 + 5 = 45 \u2714\ufe0f  \nEquation 2: -9*8 - 7*5 = -72 - 35 = -107 \u2714\ufe0f  \nBoth equations are satisfied. So the solution is correct. I can now report the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=8,y=5"
