    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form of equations: [[-2, -3, -10], [1, 4, 20]]. This likely represents:\n- Equation 1: -2x - 3y = -10\n- Equation 2: 1x + 4y = 20\n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic substitution/elimination or use the provided tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which is likely designed for solving 2-variable linear systems. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution.\n\nSince `solve2` is available and seems appropriate, I'll try calling it with the equations.\n\nBut first, I need to determine the correct format for input to `solve2`. Since the equations are given as [a, b, c] meaning ax + by = c, I can pass the list directly.\n\nLet me try ACTION: solve2 [[-2, -3, -10], [1, 4, 20]]\n\nHowever, I should be cautious \u2014 maybe `solve2` expects a different format (e.g., separate variables or matrix form). Alternatively, I could use elimination manually.\n\nLet me do a quick manual check:\nEquation 1: -2x - 3y = -10  \nEquation 2: x + 4y = 20 \u2192 multiply by 2: 2x + 8y = 40  \nAdd to Eq1: (-2x + 2x) + (-3y + 8y) = -10 + 40 \u2192 5y = 30 \u2192 y = 6  \nPlug into Eq2: x + 4*6 = 20 \u2192 x + 24 = 20 \u2192 x = -4\n\nSo solution is x = -4, y = 6.\n\nNow, to confirm, I could use `check_xy(-4, 6)` if available, but the tool is named `check_xy`, likely expecting x and y as arguments.\n\nBut the task says to use ReAct loop and only one of the actions per step. Since I have a candidate solution, and `solve2` is likely the intended tool, I'll try calling `solve2`.\n\nAssuming `solve2` takes the list of equations as input.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: x=-4.000000,y=6.000000",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned the solution x = -4.000000, y = 6.000000. This matches my manual calculation: from Eq2 (x + 4y = 20), substituting y = 6 gives x = 20 - 24 = -4. Verifying in Eq1: -2(-4) - 3(6) = 8 - 18 = -10, which matches the RHS. The solution is correct. I can now provide the final answer.\nFINAL: x=-4,y=6"
