    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n1) a1*x + b1*y = c1  \n2) a2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nSo here:  \nEquation 1: 8x + 8y = -16  \nEquation 2: -5x + 8y = 62  \n\nI can solve this manually or use the available tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the same as the equations list. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a proposed solution. Since I need to find the solution, I should try `solve2` first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[8, 8, -16], [-5, 8, 62]]",
