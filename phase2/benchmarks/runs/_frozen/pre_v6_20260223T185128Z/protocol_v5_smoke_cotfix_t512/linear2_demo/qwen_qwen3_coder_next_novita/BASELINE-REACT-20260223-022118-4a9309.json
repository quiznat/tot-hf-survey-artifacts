    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\n1) 1x - 3y = 0 \u2192 x = 3y  \n2) 1x + 7y = 30  \n\nWe need to solve this system for x and y. Let's substitute x = 3y into the second equation:  \n3y + 7y = 30 \u2192 10y = 30 \u2192 y = 3 \u2192 x = 9.  \nSo solution is (x, y) = (9, 3).  \nWe can verify using check_xy tool. Alternatively, use solve2 if available. Let's try solve2 first as it's likely designed for solving systems.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[1, -3, 0], [1, 7, -30]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solve2 tool returned x = -9.0, y = -3.0, which contradicts my earlier manual calculation. Let me double-check the equations. The input is [[1, -3, 0], [1, 7, -30]], meaning:\nEquation 1: 1\u00b7x + (-3)\u00b7y = 0 \u2192 x - 3y = 0 \u2192 x = 3y  \nEquation 2: 1\u00b7x + 7\u00b7y = -30 \u2192 x + 7y = -30  \n\nAh! I mistakenly assumed the RHS was 30, but it's actually -30 (since the third element is -30). So substituting x = 3y into x + 7y = -30 gives:  \n3y + 7y = -30 \u2192 10y = -30 \u2192 y = -3 \u2192 x = 3\u00b7(-3) = -9.  \nSo the correct solution is (x, y) = (-9, -3), matching solve2's output. Let me verify with check_xy to be certain.\n\nACTION: check_xy (-9, -3)\nFINAL: x=-9,y=-3"
