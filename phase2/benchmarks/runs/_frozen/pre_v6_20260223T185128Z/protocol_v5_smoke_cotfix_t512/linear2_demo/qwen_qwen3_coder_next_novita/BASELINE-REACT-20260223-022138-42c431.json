    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides the coefficients in the form of equations:  \nEquation 1: -7x + 8y = -25  \nEquation 2: -7x - 7y = -70  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which is designed for solving 2-variable linear systems. Let me pass the coefficient matrix and constants.\n\nThe standard form is:  \na1*x + b1*y = c1  \na2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nSo for equation 1: a1 = -7, b1 = 8, c1 = -25  \nFor equation 2: a2 = -7, b2 = -7, c2 = -70  \n\nThus, the input to `solve2` should be [[-7, 8, -25], [-7, -7, -70]], which matches the input.\n\nI'll call `solve2` with this input.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-7, 8, -25], [-7, -7, -70]]",
