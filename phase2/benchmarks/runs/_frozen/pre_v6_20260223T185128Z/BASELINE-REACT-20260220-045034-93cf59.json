    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [1, 6, 6, 6], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to compute some expression using these numbers. Common benchmark tasks with four numbers involve making 24 (the 24 game), where you use +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to reach 24.\n\nGiven numbers: 1, 6, 6, 6.\n\nLet\u2019s test possibilities:\n- 6 \u00d7 6 = 36; 36 \u2212 6 = 30; 30 \u2212 1 = 29 \u2192 too high.\n- 6 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 19 \u2192 too low.\n- (6 + 6) \u00d7 (1 + 6/",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is likely the 24 game: using [1, 6, 6, 6] with basic arithmetic to make 24. Let\u2019s explore systematically. Try grouping: (6 \u00d7 6) = 36; 36 \u2212 6 = 30; 30 \u2212 1 = 29. Not 24. Try (6 + 6 + 6) \u00d7 1 = 18. Too low. Try division: 6 / 6 = 1, then 6 \u00d7 (1 + 1 + 1) = 18. Still low. Try (6 \u00d7 6) \u2212 (6 \u00d7 1) = 36 \u2212 6 = 30. Hmm. What about (6 + 6) \u00d7 (6 / 1) = 12 \u00d7 6 = 72. Too high",

What if we do (6 + 6) \u00d7 (6 \u00f7 (1 + 6))? Wait, that uses 6 three times and 1 once, but denominator becomes 7, so 12 \u00d7 (6/7) \u2248 10.28 \u2014 no.

Now I need to verify this using the `calc` tool to ensure correctness. The expression is: (6 * (6 - 1)) - 6. Let me compute it step by step or directly.\nACTION: calc (6 * (6 - 1)) - 6",
