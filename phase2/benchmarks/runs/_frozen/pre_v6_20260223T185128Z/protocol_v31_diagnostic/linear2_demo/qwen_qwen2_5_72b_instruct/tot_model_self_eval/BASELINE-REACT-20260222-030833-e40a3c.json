    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool has provided the solutions for x and y in terms of the constants from the equations. It seems that the solution is given directly with specific values for x and y, which suggests that z might have been treated as a constant or implicitly set to a value (likely 1, considering the nature of such systems). However, since no specific value was given for z and we typically seek a general solution for all variables, let's clarify if these are the final values or if further steps are needed to express the solution in terms of z. Given the typical approach to solving such systems, it appears we have the final values for x and y assuming z is a parameter.\n\nFINAL: x = -5, y = -3, z can vary as a free parameter."
