    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: Given the task input, it seems like we have two equations in the form of [x, y, result] which likely represent linear equations such as `ax + by = c`. The first equation could be represented as `9x + 6y = 48` and the second as `-7x + 5y = 40`. To solve for x and y, I should use the 'solve2' function, which is designed to solve systems of linear equations. There's no need to check the solution beforehand since 'solve2' will provide the direct answer.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[9, 6, 48], [-7, 5, 40]]",
