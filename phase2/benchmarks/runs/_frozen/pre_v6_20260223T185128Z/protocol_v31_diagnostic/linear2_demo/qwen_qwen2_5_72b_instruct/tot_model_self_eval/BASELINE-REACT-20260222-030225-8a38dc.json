    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of linear equations. The provided input contains two equations in the form of lists, where each list represents an equation and its elements represent the coefficients of variables x and y, and the constant term, respectively. Given that there are two equations with two unknowns (x and y), we can use the `solve2` function to find the solution for x and y. Before solving, it is not necessary to use the `check_xy` tool since the equations are already in a solvable format.\n\nACTION: solve2 [6, -2, 8] [1, 9, 20]",
