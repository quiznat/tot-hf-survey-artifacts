    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a system of linear equations. The given equations are in the form of [a, b, c] which represents ax + by = c. The equations are -2x + 4y = -22 and 0x + 6y = -6. Since the second equation does not have an x term, we can solve it directly for y. Once we have y, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for x. However, since we have a tool called solve2 which is likely designed to solve a system of two linear equations, I will use that tool to find the solution.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-2, 4, -22, 0, 6, -6]",
