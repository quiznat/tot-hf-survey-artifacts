    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what to do next. The equations are presented as pairs of numbers followed by a result, like [-5, -7, -16] and [-9, 8, -70]. This looks like it could be representing systems of linear equations or some other mathematical relationship.\n\nLet me first understand what these represent:\n- First equation: [-5, -7, -16] could mean -5x - 7y = -16\n- Second equation: [-9, 8, -70] could mean -9x + 8y = -70\n\nHowever, looking at the available tools, I have \"check_xy\" and \"solve2\". Since I don't see any tool that directly handles systems of equations, let me think about what these tools might do.\n\nThe \"solve2\" tool likely solves a system of two equations with two unknown",

However, I should check if there's a specific format required for the tool input.\n\nLooking more carefully at the problem, I notice that the equations are given in a list format, but I need to make sure I'm providing the right input to the solve2 tool.
