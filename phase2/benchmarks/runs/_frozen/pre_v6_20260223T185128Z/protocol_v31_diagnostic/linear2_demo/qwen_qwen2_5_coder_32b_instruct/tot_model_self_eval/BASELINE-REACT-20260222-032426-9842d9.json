    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables. The equations are:\n1) 9x + 0y = 27\n2) -4x + 4y = -40\n\nI can see that the first equation has y coefficient as 0, which means I can solve for x directly. Then I can substitute that value into the second equation to find y.\n\nLet me start by solving the first equation for x.\nACTION: solve2 [\"9x + 0y = 27\", \"x\"]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I've solved the first equation and found x = 3. Let me verify this is correct by checking if it satisfies the first equation: 9(3) + 0(0) = 27 \u2713\n\nNow I need to verify both values satisfy the second equation: -4x + 4y = -40\nSubstituting x = 3 and y = -7:\n-4(3) + 4(-7) = -12 - 28 = -40 \u2713\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\n\nFINAL: x = 3, y = -7"
