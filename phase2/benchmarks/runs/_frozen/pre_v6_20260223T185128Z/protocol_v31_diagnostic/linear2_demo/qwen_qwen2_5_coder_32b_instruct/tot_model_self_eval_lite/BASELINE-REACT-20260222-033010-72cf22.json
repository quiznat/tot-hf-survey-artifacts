    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables. The equations are:\n1) x + y = -8 and x - y = -29\n2) -x + y = -9 and -x - y = -39\n\nLet me analyze this systematically. Looking at the format, it seems like each equation in the list represents coefficients [a, b, c] where ax + by = c.\n\nFor the first equation set [1, -8, -29], this means x + (-8)y = -29, so x - 8y = -29.\nFor the second equation set [-1, -9, -39], this means (-1)x + (-9)y = -39, so -x - 9y = -39.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem more carefully.

Let me reconsider the structure. \n\nActually, looking more carefully at the problem statement, it says \"solve a system of two linear equations with two variables\" and gives the equations as [[1, -8, -29], [-1, -9, -39]].\n\nIf we interpret this as two equations in standard form:\n- Equation 1",
