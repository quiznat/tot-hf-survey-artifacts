    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables.

For a system of two linear equations with two variables, we typically have:\n- Equation 1: a\u2081x + b\u2081y = c\u2081  \n- Equation 2: a\u2082x + b\u2082y = c\u2082\n\nBut here we have [1, -8, -29] which could represent coefficients from two equations.
