    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables. The equations are:\n1) x + y = -8 and x - y = -29\n2) -x + y = -9 and -x - y = -39\n\nLet me analyze this systematically. Looking at the format, it seems like each equation list contains coefficients [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c.\n\nFor the first equation set [1, -8, -29], this means:\n- First equation: 1*x + (-8)*y = -29 \u2192 x - 8y = -29\n- Second equation: -1*x + (-9)*y = -39 \u2192 -x - 9y = -39\n\nWait, that doesn't match the format. Let me reconsider. If we have [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c",

Maybe these represent two separate equations in the form ax + by = c where the first number is coefficient of x, second is coefficient of y, third is constant term.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the second equation [-1, -9, -39]:\n- This would be -x - 9y = -39",
