    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what operations are needed. The equations are presented as lists of three numbers each. Looking at the format [a, b, c], this likely represents a system of equations where we need to find values for variables x and y.\n\nLet me examine the equations:\n- First equation: [9, 0, 72] - This could be 9x + 0y = 72\n- Second equation: [7, 4, 92] - This could be 7x + 4y = 92\n\nThis is a system of linear equations that I can solve using the available tools. I should use the solve2 tool which is designed for solving systems of two linear equations with two unknowns.\n\nACTION: solve2 [9, 0, 72, 7, 4, 92]",
