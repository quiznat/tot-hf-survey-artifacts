    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables. The equations are:\n- Equation 1: -1x + 0y = -5\n- Equation 2: 7x + (-4)y = 35\n\nI can see that the first equation has a coefficient of 0 for y, which means it's already solved for x. Let me solve this step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1: -1x = -5, so x = 5\nNow I can substitute x = 5 into equation 2 to find y.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the solve2 tool which is designed for solving systems of linear equations. Since I have two equations with two unknowns, this would be appropriate.\n\nLet me use the solve2 tool with the given coefficients.\nACTION: solve2 [[-1, 0, -5], [7, -4, 35]]",
