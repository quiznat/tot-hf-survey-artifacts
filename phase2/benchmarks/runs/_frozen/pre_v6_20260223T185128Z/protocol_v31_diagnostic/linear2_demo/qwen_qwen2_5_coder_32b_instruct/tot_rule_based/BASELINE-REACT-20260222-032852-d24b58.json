    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task using the available tools. The task provides two equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. I have two tools: check_xy which can verify if a given x,y pair satisfies the equations, and solve2 which can solve the system of two linear equations with two unknowns.\n\nLooking at the equations:\n- Equation 1: -9x + 7y = 15\n- Equation 2: -2x + 0y = 8\n\nSince the second equation has a coefficient of 0 for y, it simplifies to -2x = 8, so x = -4.\nI can substitute x = -4 into the first equation to find y.\nAlternatively, I could use the solve2 tool directly since I have two equations with two unknowns.\n\nLet me use the solve2 tool which is designed exactly for this purpose.",
