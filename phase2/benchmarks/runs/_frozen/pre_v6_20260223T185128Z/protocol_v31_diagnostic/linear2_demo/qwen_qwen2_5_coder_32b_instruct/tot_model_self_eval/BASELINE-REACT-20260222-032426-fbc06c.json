    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of equations using the available tools. The equations are:\n1) 3x - 4y = 24\n2) -6x + 0y = 0\n\nLet me analyze this step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that equation 2 is simply -6x = 0, which means x = 0.\n\nNow I can substitute x = 0 into equation 1 to find y:\n3(0) - 4y = 24\n-4y = 24\ny = -6\n\nSo the solution should be x = 0, y = -6.\n\nI should verify this solution using the check_xy tool to make sure it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the solve2 tool which might be designed specifically for solving systems of two linear equations with two variables.\n\nLet me try using the solve2 tool first as it seems more appropriate",
