    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what to do next. The input shows two equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So I have:\n- Equation 1: -7x + 3y = 87\n- Equation 2: -6x + (-1)y = 46 (or -6x - y = 46)\n\nI need to solve this system of linear equations. I can use either the solve2 tool which is designed for solving systems of two linear equations, or I could use check_xy to verify potential solutions. Since I'm starting with the raw equations, the most logical first step is to solve the system.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-7, 3, 87], [-6, -1, 46]]\n\nFINAL: x = -3, y = 22",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I used the solve2 tool with the given equations [-7, 3, 87] and [-6, -1, 46], but the result shows x = -9 and y = 8, not x = -3 and y = 22 as I initially stated. Let me verify this solution by checking if it satisfies both original equations:\n\nEquation 1: -7x + 3y = 87\n-7(-9) + 3(8) = 63 + 24 = 87 \u2713\n\nEquation 2: -6x - y = 46\n-6(-9) - 8 = 54 - 8 = 46 \u2713\n\nThe solution x = -9, y = 8 does satisfy both equations. My initial final answer was incorrect. I should correct my response.\n\nFINAL: x = -9,"
