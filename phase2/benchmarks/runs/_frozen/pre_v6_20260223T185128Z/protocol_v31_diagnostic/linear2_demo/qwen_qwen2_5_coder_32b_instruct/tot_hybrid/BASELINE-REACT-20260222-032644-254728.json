    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations to understand what they represent and how to solve them.\n\nLooking at the equations format [a, b, c], I can see this likely represents equations of the form ax + by = c or similar linear relationships. \n\nLet me examine each equation:\n- First equation: [7, 7, 42] - This could be 7x + 7y = 42\n- Second equation: [-5, 9, 82] - This could be -5x + 9y = 82\n\nI should use the available tools to solve this system of equations. The solve2 tool seems appropriate for solving systems of two linear equations with two variables.\n\nACTION: solve2 [\"7x + 7y = 42\", \"\u22125x + 9y = 82\"]\n\nWait, let me reconsider.
