The equations are:\n1) 8x + (-7)y = 46\n2) 9x + (-5)y = 46\n\nI can use the solve2 tool which is designed to solve systems of two linear equations with two variables. The tool expects the coefficients in the format [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c for each equation.\n\nFor the first equation 8x - 7y = 46, I'll provide [8, -7, 46]\nFor the second equation 9x - 5y = 46, I'll provide [9, -5, 46]\n\nI'll call the solve2 tool with both equations as inputs.\nACTION: solve2 [[8, -7, 46], [9, -5, 46]]",
