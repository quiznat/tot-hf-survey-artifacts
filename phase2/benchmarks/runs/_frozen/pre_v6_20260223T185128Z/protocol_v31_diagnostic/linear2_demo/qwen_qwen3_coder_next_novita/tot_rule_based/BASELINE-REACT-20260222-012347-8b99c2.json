    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n-1\u00b7x + 2\u00b7y = -15  \n3\u00b7x - 5\u00b7y = 41  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2\u00d72 linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the coefficient matrix and constants \u2014 possibly as [[a1, b1], [a2, b2]] and [c1, c2], or maybe just the augmented form. Since the input is given as [[-1, 2, -15], [3, -",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations given as [[-1, 2, -15], [3, -5, 41]], which corresponds to:  \n-1\u00b7x + 2\u00b7y = -15  \n3\u00b7x - 5\u00b7y = 41  \n\nI need to determine how to use the available tools. `solve2` is likely designed for solving 2\u00d72 linear systems. Since the input format matches the augmented matrix (coefficients + constant term per row), `solve2` probably accepts this exact format. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution, but I don\u2019t yet have a candidate. So the best first step is to call `solve2` with the given equations. I\u2019ll assume `solve2` takes the list of equations in the same format as the input.  \nACTION: solve2 [[-1, 2,",
