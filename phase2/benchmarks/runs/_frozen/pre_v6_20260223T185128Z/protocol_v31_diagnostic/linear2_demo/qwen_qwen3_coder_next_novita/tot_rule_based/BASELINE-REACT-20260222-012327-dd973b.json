    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations like a*x + b*y = c or similar. We need to find values for x and y that satisfy both equations. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a system of two equations).

Since `solve2` probably expects a structured input (e.g., list of equations), we can pass the list `[[9, 6, 48], [-7, 5,",

Since `solve2` is likely designed for this exact purpose, I should call it with the list of equations. I'll assume `solve2` accepts the list of [a, b, c] triples directly.
