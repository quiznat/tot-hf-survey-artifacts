Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two linear equations, and we have exactly two equations, it's appropriate to use `solve2` with the list of equations.\n\nLet\u2019s use `solve2` with the equations provided.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[9, 6, 48], [-7, 5, 40]]",

Let's verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool to ensure it satisfies both equations:  \n1) 9x + 6y = 9*0 + 6*8 = 0 + 48 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) -7x + 5y = -7*0 + 5*8 = 0 + 40 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nThe solution is correct.
