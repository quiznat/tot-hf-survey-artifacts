    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays. Each inner list likely represents an equation in the form [a, b, c] corresponding to ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -8x - y = 33  \nEquation 2: -8x - 7y = -9  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let's use algebra: subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate x.\n\nEquation 1: -8x - y = 33  \nEquation 2: -8x - 7y = -9  \nSubtract Eq2 from Eq1:  \n(-8x - y) - (-8x - 7y) = 33 - (-9)  \n\u2192 -8x - y + 8x + 7y = 42  \n\u2192 6y = 4",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From the scratchpad, we derived 6y = 4, so y = 4/6 = 2/3. Now substitute y = 2/3 into one of the original equations to solve for x. Using Equation 1: -8x - y = 33 \u2192 -8x - 2/3 = 33 \u2192 -8x = 33 + 2/3 = 101/3 \u2192 x = -(101/3)/8 = -101/24. So the solution is x = -101/24, y = 2/3. Let's verify using the second equation to ensure consistency. Plug into Eq2: -8x - 7y = -8*(-101/24) - 7*(2/3) = (808/24) - (14",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Let me complete the verification step. From earlier: x = -101/24, y = 2/3. Plug into Eq2: -8x - 7y = -8*(-101/24) - 7*(2/3) = (808/24) - (14/3) = (101/3) - (14/3) = 87/3 = 29. But Eq2 RHS is -9, not 29 \u2014 contradiction! So I made an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me recompute subtraction: Eq1: -8x - y = 33; Eq2: -8x - 7y = -9. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: (-8x - y) - (-8x - 7y) = 33 - (-9) \u2192 -8x",

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I made an arithmetic error in the subtraction step. Let me carefully recompute. Equation 1: -8x - y = 33. Equation 2: -8x - 7y = -9. Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:  \nLeft side: (-8x - y) - (-8x - 7y) = -8x - y + 8x + 7y = 6y  \nRight side: 33 - (-9) = 42  \nSo 6y = 42 \u2192 y = 7. That's correct! My earlier mistake was computing 33 - (-9) as 4 instead of 42. Now substitute y = 7 into Equation 1: -8x - 7 = 33 \u2192 -8x = 40 \u2192 x = -5. Verify with Equation 2: -8",

So the solution is x = -5, y = 7. Now I should use the available tools to confirm. Since solve2 is likely designed for solving 2-variable linear systems, I'll use it with the coefficient arrays from the input."
