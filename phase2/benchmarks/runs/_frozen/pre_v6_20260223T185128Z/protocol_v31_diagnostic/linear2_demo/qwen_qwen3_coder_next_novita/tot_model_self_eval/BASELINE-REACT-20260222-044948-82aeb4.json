    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n1) a1*x + b1*y = c1  \n2) a2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nSo here:  \n5x - 2y = -17  \n-3x + 4y = -15  \n\nI need to find (x, y). I can either use algebraic methods or call the available tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the coefficient matrix and constants \u2014 possibly as [[a1, b1], [a2, b2]] and [c1, c2], or directly the augmented rows. Since the input is given as [[5",

Since `solve2` is designed for solving 2-variable systems, I should use it first. The input format for `solve2` is likely the coefficient matrix and constants \u2014 possibly as a list of equations in the same format as the input, or as separate coefficient and constant arrays. Given the input structure matches standard augmented matrix rows, `solve2` probably accepts the full list [[5, -2, -17], [-3, 4, -15]] or just the coefficients",
