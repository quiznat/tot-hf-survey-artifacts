    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input contains a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c. We have two equations:  \n1. -4x + 8y = -56  \n2. 9x + 9y = 45  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two linear equations, and we have exactly two equations, I should use `solve2` with the given equations.\n\nLet me format the input for `solve2`. Assuming it expects the equations as a list of lists: [[-4, 8, -56], [9, 9, 45]].\n\nSo, ACTION: solve2 [[-4, 8, -56], [9, 9, 45]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solution from `solve2` gives x = 8.0 and y = -3.0. To verify correctness, I should use `check_xy` with these values and the original equations to ensure they satisfy both equations.\n\nThe equations are:\n1. -4x + 8y = -56  \n2. 9x + 9y = 45  \n\nPlugging in x = 8, y = -3:\n- Equation 1: -4(8) + 8(-3) = -32 - 24 = -56 \u2714\ufe0f  \n- Equation 2: 9(8) + 9(-3) = 72 - 27 = 45 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nSo the solution is correct. Since the verification confirms it, I can now provide the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=8,y=-3"
