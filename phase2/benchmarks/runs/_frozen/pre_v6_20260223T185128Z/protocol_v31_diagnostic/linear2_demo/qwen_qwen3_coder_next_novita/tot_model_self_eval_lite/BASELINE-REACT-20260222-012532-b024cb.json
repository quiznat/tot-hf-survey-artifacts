    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c.

Since `solve2` likely solves a 2-variable linear system directly, and we have exactly 2 equations, I should use `solve2` with the equations.\n\nTool input format is unclear, but likely `solve2` expects the coefficients and constants \u2014 perhaps as a list of equations or two equations. Given the input format is a list of lists, I\u2019ll pass the entire `equations` list to `solve2`.\n\nLet me try ACTION: solve2 [[-4, 8, -56],",
