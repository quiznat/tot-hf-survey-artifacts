    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The manual calculation yields x = 9, y = -6. To verify correctness, I should use the `check_xy` tool with x=9 and y=-6 to confirm both equations are satisfied. Alternatively, I could call `solve2` directly if it accepts the matrix representation. Since `solve2` is likely designed for this exact input format (list of equations as coefficient+constant arrays), I\u2019ll use that first for efficiency and reliability.\nACTION: solve2 [[1, 1, 3], [-2, 3, -36]]",
