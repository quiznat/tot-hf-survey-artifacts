    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n1) 6x + 1y = -28\n2) 8x + 6y = 0\n\nWe need to solve this system for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (presumably to solve a 2-variable system). Since `solve2` is directly applicable to a system of two linear equations, we should use it.\n\nThe input format for `solve2` is likely the list of equations, i.e., [[6,1,-28],[8,6,0]].\n\nLet\u2019s use `solve2` with the given equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[6, 1, -28], [8, 6, 0",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: x=-6.000000,y=8.000000",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned the solution x = -6.0, y = 8.0. To ensure correctness, we should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool with the original equations: 6x + y = -28 and 8x + 6y = 0. Plugging in x = -6, y = 8:\n\n1) 6*(-6) + 1*8 = -36 + 8 = -28 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) 8*(-6) + 6*8 = -48 + 48 = 0 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo the solution is correct. We can now report the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=-6, y=8"
