    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in two variables, represented as augmented matrices:  \nEquation 1: 2x - 4y = 22  \nEquation 2: -3x - 4y = 17  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (presumably to solve a 2\u00d72 system). Since `solve2` is likely designed for this exact purpose, I should use it first.\n\nTool input for `solve2` should be the system of equations \u2014 likely as a list of equations or coefficient-augmented rows. Given the input format is `[[2, -4, 22], [-3, -4, 17]]`, `solve2` probably expects this exact structure.\n\nLet me call `solve2` with the equations.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The observation \"no-action\" suggests that `solve2` may not have executed or returned a result \u2014 possibly because the tool call was not properly formatted or the tool requires a different input structure. Alternatively, maybe `solve2` expects a different representation (e.g., separate coefficients or a string). Since I don\u2019t have feedback from `solve2`, I should try using `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions after solving manually.\n\nLet me solve the system manually:\n\nEquation 1: 2x - 4y = 22  \nEquation 2: -3x - 4y = 17  \n\nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate y:  \n(2x - (-3x)) + (-4y - (-4y)) = 22 - 17  \n\u2192 5x + 0 = 5  \n\u2192 x = 1  \n\nPlug x =",
