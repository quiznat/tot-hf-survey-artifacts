    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) 8x - 7y = 46  \n2) 9x - 5y = 46  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two linear equations with two variables, we can solve the system. Let's try to eliminate one variable. Multiply equation 1 by 5 and equation 2 by 7 to eliminate y:\n\nEq1 *5: 40x - 35y = 230  \nEq2 *7: 63x - 35y = 322  \n\nSubtract Eq1*5 from Eq2*7:  \n(63x - 35y) - (40x - 35y) =",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the elimination method:  \n(63x - 35y) - (40x - 35y) = 23x  \n322 - 230 = 92  \nSo 23x = 92 \u2192 x = 4.  \n\nNow substitute x = 4 into one of the original equations to find y. Using equation 1:  \n8(4) - 7y = 46 \u2192 32 - 7y = 46 \u2192 -7y = 14 \u2192 y = -2.  \n\nSo the solution is x = 4, y = -2. Let's verify with the second equation:  \n9(4) - 5(-2) = 36 + 10 = 46 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nSince the system is solved, and we have the solution, we can now use the `",
