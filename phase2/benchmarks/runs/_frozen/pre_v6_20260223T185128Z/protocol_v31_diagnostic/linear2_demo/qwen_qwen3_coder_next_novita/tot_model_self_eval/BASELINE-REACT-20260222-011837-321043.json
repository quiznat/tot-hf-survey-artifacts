    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -8x + 7y = -72  \nEquation 2: 6x - 4y = 44  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which is likely designed for solving 2x2 linear systems. Let me try that first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-8, 7, -72], [6, -4, 44]]",
