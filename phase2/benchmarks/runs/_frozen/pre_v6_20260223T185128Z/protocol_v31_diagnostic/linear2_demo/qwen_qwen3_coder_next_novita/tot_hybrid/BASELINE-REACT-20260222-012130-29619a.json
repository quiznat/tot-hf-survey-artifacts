    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations of the form ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n1) 5x - 6y = 58  \n2) -4x + 8y = -56  \n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let's consider using the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the coefficients matrix and constants vector. Given the equations, I can structure the input as the coefficient matrix [[5, -6], [-4, 8]] and constants [58, -56]. Alternatively, the tool might accept the equations in the same format as the input, i.e.,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations given as [[5, -6, 58], [-4, 8, -56]], which corresponds to:\n1) 5x - 6y = 58  \n2) -4x + 8y = -56  \n\nI need to determine the correct input format for the `solve2` tool. Since the input format matches [a, b, c] for ax + by = c, `solve2` likely expects either a list of equations in this format or a structured input like coefficients and constants. To be safe, I\u2019ll try passing the full list of equations directly to `solve2`, as that matches the given input structure. Alternatively, if `solve2` expects a different format (e.g., [[a1,b1],[a2,b2]] and [c1,c2]), I may need to restructure,",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve the system of equations:  \n1) 5x - 6y = 58  \n2) -4x + 8y = -56  \n\nI have two tools: `check_xy` (likely verifies a candidate solution) and `solve2` (presumably solves a 2-variable linear system). Since the input format is [[a, b, c], ...] for equations ax + by = c, `solve2` likely accepts this exact format. I\u2019ll try calling `solve2` with the full equations list. If it fails or returns an error, I\u2019ll adjust. But given the task context, `solve2` should handle this directly.\nACTION: solve2 [[5, -6, 58], [-4, 8, -56]]",
