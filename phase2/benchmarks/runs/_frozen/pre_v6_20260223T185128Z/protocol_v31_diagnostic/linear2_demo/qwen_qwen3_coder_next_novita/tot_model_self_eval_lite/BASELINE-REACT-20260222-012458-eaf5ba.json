    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) 8x - 7y = 46  \n2) 9x - 5y = 46  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve the system. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2x2 system). Given that `solve2` is directly for solving 2 equations, it's the most appropriate first step.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[8, -7, 46], [9, -5, 46]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solution from solve2 gives x=4.0 and y=-2.0. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the check_xy tool by plugging x=4 and y=-2 into both original equations:  \n1) 8*4 - 7*(-2) = 32 + 14 = 46 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) 9*4 - 5*(-2) = 36 + 10 = 46 \u2714\ufe0f  \nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\n\nACTION: check_xy 4 -2\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: True\nFINAL: x=4, y=-2"
