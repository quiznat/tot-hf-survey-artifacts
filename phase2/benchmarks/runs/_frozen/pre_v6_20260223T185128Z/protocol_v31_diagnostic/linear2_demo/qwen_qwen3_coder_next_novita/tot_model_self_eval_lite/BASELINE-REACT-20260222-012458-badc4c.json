    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two quadratic equations in the form [a, b, c], representing ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0.

The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a system of two equations). Since we have two separate equations, not a system, perhaps `solve2` expects two equations as input (e.g., as a list of two [a,b,c] pairs), or maybe it solves a system of two equations in two variables.
