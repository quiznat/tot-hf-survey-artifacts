    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides a system of two linear equations in two variables, represented as coefficients:  \nEquation 1: -8x - 3y = -66  \nEquation 2: 1x - 8y = -42  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2x2 system directly). Since `solve2` is designed for this purpose, I should use it first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-8, -3, -66], [1, -8, -42]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solution returned by solve2 is x = 6.0, y = 6.0. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the check_xy tool by plugging x = 6 and y = 6 into both original equations.\n\nACTION: check_xy 6 6\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: Equation 1: -8*6 - 3*6 = -48 - 18 = -66 \u2713  \nEquation 2: 1*6 - 8*6 = 6 - 48 = -42 \u2713  \nBoth equations are satisfied.\n\nFINAL: x=6,y=6"
