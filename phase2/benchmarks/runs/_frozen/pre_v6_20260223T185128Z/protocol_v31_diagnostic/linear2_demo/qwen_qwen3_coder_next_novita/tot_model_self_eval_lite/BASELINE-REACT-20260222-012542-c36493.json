    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in two variables (likely x and y), represented as coefficients and constants. Each inner list has three elements: [a, b, c] corresponding to the equation a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -9x + 1y = -37\nEquation 2: 8x - 6y = -8\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2x2 system). Since `solve2` is directly for solving 2 equations, that seems most appropriate.\n\nLet\u2019s use `solve2` with the equations. The tool likely expects the coefficients in a specific format \u2014 probably the full system as a list of equations, each with [a, b, c].\n\nSo input",

The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (presumably to solve a 2\u00d72 system). Since `solve2` is designed for solving such systems, it's the appropriate first step.

To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool by plugging x = 5 and y = 8 into both original equations.\n\nOriginal equations:\n1. -9x + y = -37 \u2192 -9(5) + 8 = -45 + 8 = -37 \u2713\n2. 8x - 6y = -8 \u2192 8(5) - 6(8) = 40 - 48 = -8 \u2713\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\n\nACTION: check_xy 5 8\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: True\nFINAL: x=5,y=8"
