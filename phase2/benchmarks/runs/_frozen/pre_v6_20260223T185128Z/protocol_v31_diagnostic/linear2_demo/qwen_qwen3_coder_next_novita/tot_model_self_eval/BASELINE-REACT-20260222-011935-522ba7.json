    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represent linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) 5x - 5y = 65  \n2) 6x - 2y = 42  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve this system. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2x2 system). Given that `solve2` is directly available and appropriate for this task, we should use it.\n\nLet\u2019s call `solve2` with the two equations as input.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[5, -5, 65], [6, -2, 42]]",
