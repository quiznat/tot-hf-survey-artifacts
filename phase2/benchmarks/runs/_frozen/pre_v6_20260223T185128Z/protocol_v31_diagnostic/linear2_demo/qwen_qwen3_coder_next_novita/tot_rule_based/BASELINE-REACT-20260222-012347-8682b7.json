    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \nEquation 1: 5x - 2y = -17  \nEquation 2: -3x + 4y = -15  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2\u00d72 linear system given the coefficient matrix and constants. Let me confirm the expected input format for `solve2`. Since it's not specified, I'll assume it takes the augmented matrix or the coefficient matrix and RHS separately. Given the structure, `solve2([[5, -2], [-3, 4]], [-17, -15])` might be appropriate, but the input is given as",

The `solve2` tool is likely designed for solving 2\u00d72 systems. Since the input format matches the augmented matrix (coefficients + RHS), `solve2` probably accepts the full augmented matrix directly.
