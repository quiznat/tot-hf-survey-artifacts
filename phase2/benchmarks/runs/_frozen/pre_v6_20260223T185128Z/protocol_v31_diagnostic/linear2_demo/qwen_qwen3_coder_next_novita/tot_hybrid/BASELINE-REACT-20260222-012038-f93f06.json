    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Based on the scratchpad, I have deduced the solution is x=8, y=9 by solving the system manually. To confirm correctness, I should use the check_xy tool with x=8 and y=9 to verify both equations hold. Alternatively, solve2 might directly return the solution, but since the task is to solve and verify, and check_xy is available, I'll verify first. However, the most efficient step is to call solve2 with the input equations, as it's designed for this purpose. The input format [[9,0,72],[7,4,92]] matches what solve2 likely expects. So I'll use solve2.\nACTION: solve2 [[9, 0, 72], [7, 4, 92]]",
