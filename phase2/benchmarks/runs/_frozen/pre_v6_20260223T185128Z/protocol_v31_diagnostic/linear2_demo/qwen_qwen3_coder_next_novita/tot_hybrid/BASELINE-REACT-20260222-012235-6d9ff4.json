    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n1) a1*x + b1*y = c1  \n2) a2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nSo here:  \n7x + 1y = 51  \n-7x -3y = -69  \n\nI can solve this manually or use the `solve2` tool if it's designed for 2-variable linear systems. Let me first try to solve manually to verify.  \n\nAdd the two equations:  \n(7x - 7x) + (y - 3y) = 51 + (-69)  \n\u2192 -2y = -18 \u2192 y = 9  \n\nPlug y = 9 into first equation:  \n7x +",

From earlier:  \n7x + y = 51, and y = 9 \u2192 7x + 9 = 51 \u2192 7x = 42 \u2192 x = 6.  \nSo solution is x = 6, y = 9.  \nI can verify using the second equation: -7x -3y = -7*6 -3*9 = -42 -27 = -69 \u2713  \nNow I should confirm using the `check_xy` tool to validate (x=6, y=9) against both equations, or use `solve2` to get the solution directly. Since `solve2` is likely designed for this, I'll use it.  \n`solve2` probably expects the equations in the same format as input: [[7,1,51],[-7,-3,-69]].  \nLet me",
