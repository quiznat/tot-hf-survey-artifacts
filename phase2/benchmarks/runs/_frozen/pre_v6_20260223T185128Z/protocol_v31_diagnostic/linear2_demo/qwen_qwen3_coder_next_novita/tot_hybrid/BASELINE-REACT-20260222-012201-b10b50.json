    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input contains two equations represented as coefficient arrays: [-9, 7, 15] and [-2, 0, 8]. Typically, such arrays represent linear equations in the form ax + by = c. So:\n- First equation: -9x + 7y = 15\n- Second equation: -2x + 0y = 8 \u2192 -2x = 8 \u2192 x = -4\n\nWe can solve this system manually or use the available tools. Since solve2 is available and likely designed for solving 2-variable linear systems, we should use it. But we need to format the input correctly \u2014 likely as a list of equations, each as [a, b, c].\n\nLet\u2019s use solve2 with the equations provided.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-9, 7, 15], [-2, 0, 8]]",

To be thorough and follow the ReAct loop, I should confirm with check_xy.\n\nACTION: check_xy -4 -3 [[-9, 7, 15], [-2, 0, 8]]",
