    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \nEquation 1: 6x - 7y = -18  \nEquation 2: 4x + 4y = 40  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system given coefficients. Let me try that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[6, -7, -18], [4, 4, 40]]",
