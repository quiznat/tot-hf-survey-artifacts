    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -3x + 3y = -3  \nEquation 2: 5x - 8y = -13  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since there are two equations and two unknowns, we can use solve2, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. Let's use solve2 with the equations provided.\n\nThe input format for solve2 is likely the list of equations, i.e., [[-3, 3, -3], [5, -8, -13]].\n\nLet\u2019s call solve2 with this input.\nACTION: solve2 [[-3, 3, -3], [5, -8, -13]]",
