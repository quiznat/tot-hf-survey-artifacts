    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -2x + 5y = 3  \nEquation 2: 8x + 2y = -34  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two linear equations, that seems like the appropriate first step.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-2, 5, 3], [8, 2, -34]]",

To verify correctness, I should use the `check_xy` tool to plug these values back into both original equations and confirm they satisfy both.\n\nACTION: check_xy -4 -1 [[-2, 5, 3], [8, 2, -34]]\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: Both equations are satisfied.\nFINAL: x=-4,y=-1"
