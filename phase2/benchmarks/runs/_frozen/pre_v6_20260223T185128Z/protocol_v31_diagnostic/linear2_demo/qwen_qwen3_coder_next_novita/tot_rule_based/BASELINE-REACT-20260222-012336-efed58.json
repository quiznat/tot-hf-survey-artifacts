    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n- Equation 1: -2x + 5y = 3\n- Equation 2: 8x + 2y = -34\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can use algebraic methods (e.g., substitution or elimination), or use the provided tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution.\n\nGiven that `solve2` is likely designed for solving such systems, I'll use it. But I need to format the input appropriately \u2014 perhaps as a list of equations or coefficients.\n\nLet me assume `solve2` expects the coefficient matrix and constants, e.g., `[[a1",
