    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations like ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 5x - 5y = 65  \nEquation 2: 6x - 2y = 42  \n\nWe need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-equation system). Since `solve2` is likely designed for this purpose, I should use it first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[5, -5, 65], [6, -2, 42]]",

To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool, since the task may require validation before finalizing.\n\nACTION: check_xy 4 -9\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: True\nTHINK: The `check_xy` tool confirmed that x = 4 and y = -9 satisfies both equations. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\nFINAL: x=4,y=-9"
