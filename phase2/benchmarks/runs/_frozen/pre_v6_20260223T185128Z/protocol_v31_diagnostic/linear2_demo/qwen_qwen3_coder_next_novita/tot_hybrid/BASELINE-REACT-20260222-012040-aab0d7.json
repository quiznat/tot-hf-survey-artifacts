    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n1) 2x + 7y = -30\n2) -6x + 3y = 42\n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the available tools. Let's consider using solve2, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. Alternatively, check_xy could verify a candidate solution.\n\nSince solve2 is likely designed for this purpose, I'll try using it first. I need to pass the equations in a format it expects \u2014 probably as a list of equations, each as [a, b, c].\n\nLet me try ACTION: solve2 [[2, 7, -30], [-6, 3, 42]]\n\nBut wait",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solve2 tool returned a solution: x = -8.0, y = -2.0. I should verify this solution using the check_xy tool to ensure it satisfies both original equations:  \n1) 2x + 7y = 2*(-8) + 7*(-2) = -16 -14 = -30 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) -6x + 3y = -6*(-8) + 3*(-2) = 48 - 6 = 42 \u2714\ufe0f  \nThe solution is correct. Since verification passes, I can now report the final answer.\nFINAL: x=-8,y=-2"
