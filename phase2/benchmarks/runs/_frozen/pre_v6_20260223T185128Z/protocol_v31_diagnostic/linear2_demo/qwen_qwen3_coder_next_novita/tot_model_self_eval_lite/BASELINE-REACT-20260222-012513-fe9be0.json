    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \nEquation 1: a1*x + b1*y = c1 \u2192 -7x + 3y = -30  \nEquation 2: a2*x + b2*y = c2 \u2192 -4x -5y = 3  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system given the coefficient matrix and constants. Let me prepare the input for `solve2`. Typically, such a tool expects either the augmented matrix or separate coefficient and constant arrays. Since the format matches the augmented rows, I\u2019ll pass the list of equations directly.\n\nAlternatively, I could use `check_xy",
