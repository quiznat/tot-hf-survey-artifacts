    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays: [4, 9, -9] and [9, -1, 86]. Assuming these represent linear equations in two variables x and y, the format is likely: a*x + b*y = c. So:\n\nEquation 1: 4x + 9y = -9  \nEquation 2: 9x - y = 86\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let's try solving manually first.\n\nFrom Equation 2: 9x - y = 86 \u2192 y = 9x - 86\n\nSubstitute into Equation 1:  \n4x + 9(9x - 86) = -9  \n4x + 81x - 774 = -9  \n85x = 765  \nx = 765 /",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The manual derivation shows x = 765 / 85 = 9. Then y = 9x - 86 = 9*9 - 86 = 81 - 86 = -5. So solution is x=9, y=-5. To verify, we can use the check_xy tool with x=9, y=-5. Alternatively, use solve2 which likely solves the system directly. Since solve2 is available and designed for this, we should use it first for correctness and efficiency. Input should be the equations as given: [[4,9,-9],[9,-1,86]].\nACTION: solve2 [[4,9,-9],[9,-1,86]]",
