    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], representing linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 4x + 9y = -9  \nEquation 2: 9x - y = 86  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two linear equations with two variables, we can solve this system. The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2x2 system). Given that `solve2` is directly for solving 2 equations, it's the appropriate tool to use first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[4, 9, -9], [9, -1, 86]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solution from `solve2` gives x = 9.0 and y = -5.0. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool by plugging x=9 and y=-5 into both original equations.\n\nACTION: check_xy 9 -5 [[4, 9, -9], [9, -1, 86]]\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: Verified: 4*9 + 9*(-5) = 36 - 45 = -9 \u2713  \n9*9 + (-1)*(-5) = 81 + 5 = 86 \u2713  \nBoth equations are satisfied.\n\nFINAL: x=9, y=-5"
