    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \na1*x + b1*y = c1  \na2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nSo here:  \n2x - 4y = 22  \n-3x - 4y = 17  \n\nI need to find (x, y) satisfying both. I can use algebraic methods (e.g., elimination or substitution), or use the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2x2 system directly. If not, I can use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions. First, try `solve2` with the equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[2, -4, 22], [-3, -4,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x=1.0, y=-5.0 as a solution. I should verify this solution using the original equations to ensure correctness. Let's plug (x=1, y=-5) into both equations:\n\n1) 2x - 4y = 2(1) - 4(-5) = 2 + 20 = 22 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) -3x - 4y = -3(1) - 4(-5) = -3 + 20 = 17 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nBoth equations are satisfied. Alternatively, I could use `check_xy` to confirm, but manual verification already confirms correctness. Since the solution is validated, I can now provide the final answer.\n\nFINAL: (1, -5)"
