    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:  \n1) -5x - 5y = 15  \n2) 8x + 7y = -20  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-equation system). Given the context, `solve2` is the appropriate tool to directly solve the system.\n\nTool input for `solve2` should likely be the list of equations in the same format as the input: [[-5, -5, 15], [8, 7, -20]].",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool successfully solved the system of equations and returned x = 1.0 and y = -4.0. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool with the original equations. Substituting x = 1 and y = -4 into the equations:  \n1) -5(1) - 5(-4) = -5 + 20 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) 8(1) + 7(-4) = 8 - 28 = -20 \u2714\ufe0f  \nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\nACTION: check_xy 1 -4\nFINAL: x=1.000000,y=-4.000000"
