    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in two variables, represented as coefficients and constants. Each inner list [a, b, c] corresponds to the equation a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 5x - 6y = -42  \nEquation 2: -4x + 6y = 36  \n\nWe can solve this system using algebraic methods (e.g., elimination or substitution). Notice that the coefficients of y are -6 and +6 \u2014 they are opposites, so adding the equations will eliminate y.\n\nLet\u2019s add the two equations:\n(5x - 6y) + (-4x + 6y) = -42 + 36  \n\u2192 (5x - 4x) + (-6y + 6y) = -6  \n\u2192 x + 0 = -6  \n\u2192 x",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From the addition of the equations, we found x = -6. Now we can substitute x = -6 into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use Equation 1: 5x - 6y = -42. Substituting x = -6 gives: 5*(-6) - 6y = -42 \u2192 -30 - 6y = -42 \u2192 -6y = -12 \u2192 y = 2. So the solution is (x, y) = (-6, 2). To verify, we can use the check_xy tool with x = -6 and y = 2. Alternatively, since solve2 is available and likely designed for this purpose, we can call solve2 directly on the equations. Let's use solve2 for correctness and efficiency.  \nACTION: solve2 [[5, -6, -42], [-4,",
