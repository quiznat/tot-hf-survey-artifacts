    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations.

I can either use algebraic substitution/elimination or call a solver tool. Since 'solve2' is available, it likely solves a 2-equation system. Let me try using solve2 with the equations. The input format for solve2 may expect the coefficients as given, or perhaps as a list of equations. I'll assume it takes the list of coefficient triples directly.\n\nAlternatively, check_xy might verify a",

Since `solve2` is designed for this purpose, I should use it first. I need to determine the correct input format. Given the input is `[[1, 1, 3], [-2, 3, -36]]`, representing equations `a*x + b*y = c`, `solve2` probably accepts this exact format. I'll call `solve2` with this input.",
