    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. We have two equations:  \n1) 7x + 7y = 42  \n2) -5x + 9y = 82  \n\nWe need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two linear equations, that seems like the appropriate first step. Let's use `solve2` with the two equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[7, 7, 42], [-5, 9, 82]]",
