We need to find the largest permutation divisible by 4.\n\nRecall: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nDigits: [3, 1, 6, 2]. All permutations (descending order to find max first):\n\nStart from largest possible: 6321 \u2192 last two digits = 21 \u2192 21 mod 4 = 1 \u2192 not divisible  \nNext: 6312 \u2192 last two digits = 12 \u2192 12 mod 4",
