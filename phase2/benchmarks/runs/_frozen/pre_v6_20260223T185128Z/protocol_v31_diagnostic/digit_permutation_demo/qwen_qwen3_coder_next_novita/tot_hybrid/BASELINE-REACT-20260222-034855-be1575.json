    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 8.

But I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, I should check if 4312 is divisible by 8 using the `is_divisible` tool. If yes, and it's the maximum possible (i.e., no larger permutation is divisible by 8), then it's the answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, I could use `best_divisible` directly if it's designed to return the maximum permutation divisible by the divisor.\n\nLet me recall: `best_divisible(digits, divisor)` likely returns the largest number",

If it returns 4312, and `is_divisible(4312, 8)` confirms divisibility, then I can conclude.\n\nLet me start by calling `best_divisible` with the given digits and divisor.\nACTION: best_divisible [4, 1, 2, 3] 8",
