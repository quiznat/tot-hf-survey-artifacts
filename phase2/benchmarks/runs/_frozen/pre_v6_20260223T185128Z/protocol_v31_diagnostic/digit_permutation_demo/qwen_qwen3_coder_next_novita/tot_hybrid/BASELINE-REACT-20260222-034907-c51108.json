    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 2, 4, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 2443, which suggests that the maximum possible number from the digits is 4432, but the largest *divisible* number is claimed to be 2443. However, 2443 uses digits [2,4,4,3] \u2014 same multiset \u2014 so it's a candidate. First, I should verify if 2443 is divisible by 7 using the is_divisible tool. If yes, then I need to check whether it's indeed the maximum divisible number \u2014 but since the oracle says max is 2443, maybe it's correct. Let's verify divisibility first.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 24",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The is_divisible tool returned \"no\" for input 24 \u2014 but that\u2019s not the number we want to test. I mistakenly input 24 instead of 2443. I need to test 2443 for divisibility by 7. Let me correct that.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 2443",
