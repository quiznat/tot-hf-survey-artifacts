    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 2] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 9420, which suggests that 9420 is the correct answer \u2014 but I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, recall: A number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n- Divisible by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 0, 2, 4.\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 15 \u2192 divisible by 3, so any permutation is divisible by 3. So only need to ensure last digit is even.\n\nTo maximize the number, try descending permutations",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 9420. Let's verify if 9420 is divisible by 6 using the is_divisible tool. Since 9420 ends in 0 (even), it's divisible by 2. Sum of digits = 9+4+2+0 = 15, divisible by 3, so it should be divisible by 6. But I should confirm with the tool to be safe. Alternatively, I could use best_divisible to directly get the answer, but since the oracle_max is provided and likely correct, verifying is_divisible(9420, 6) is efficient. Let's do that first.\nACTION: is_divisible 9420 6",
