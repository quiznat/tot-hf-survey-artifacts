    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 0, 9, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 9650. Since the oracle_max is given, it likely represents the correct answer. But to follow the ReAct loop properly, I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, recall: a number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5.\n\nDigits: [6, 0, 9, 5]. To maximize the number, we want descending order, but must end in 0 or 5.\n\nPossible candidates in descending order:\n- Try 9650 (ends in 0) \u2192 uses all digits.\n- Next: 9605 (ends in 5), then 9560, etc.\n\n96",
