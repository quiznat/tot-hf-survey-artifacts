    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 7] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 7560, which suggests that 7560 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible permutation divisible by 7). Let's verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, I should check if 7560 is divisible by 7 using the is_divisible tool. If yes, and it's the maximum possible (since digits sorted descending is 7650, but 7650 may not be divisible by 7; 7560 is the next candidate), then 7560 is likely the answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools. Let's first try is_divisible with 7560 and divisor 7.\n\nACTION:",
