    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number \u2264 6643 that can be formed using the digits [6, 6, 3, 4] (each used exactly once) and is divisible by 7. We have two tools: `is_divisible(n, d)` to check if n is divisible by d, and `best_divisible(digits, divisor, max_val)` which likely returns the largest number \u2264 max_val formed from digits divisible by divisor. Since `best_divisible` is directly available and matches the task, I should use it first to get the answer efficiently.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [6, 6, 3, 4] 7 6643",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The tool `best_divisible` returned 6643. Now I need to verify if this is correct: does 6643 use exactly the digits [6, 6, 3, 4]? Let's check: digits of 6643 are 6, 6, 4, 3 \u2014 yes, matches [6, 6, 3, 4] (order doesn\u2019t matter). Also, is it divisible by 7? Since the tool returned it as a divisible candidate, and the oracle_max is 6643, it's likely correct. But to be safe, I should confirm divisibility using `is_divisible`.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 6643 7",
