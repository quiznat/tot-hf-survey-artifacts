    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 8, 4, 6] that is divisible by 3, and we are told the oracle_max is 8664. Let's verify if 8664 is divisible by 3. Sum of digits of 8664 = 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 24, and 24 is divisible by 3, so 8664 is divisible by 3. Also, 8664 uses digits [8,6,6,4] \u2014 which matches our available digits [6,8,4,6] (two 6s, one 8, one 4). So 8664 is a valid candidate. Since it's given as oracle_max, it's likely the correct answer. But to be thorough,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 8664, and we verified that it uses the correct digits [6,8,4,6] (two 6s, one 8, one 4) and is divisible by 3 (digit sum = 24). Since the task is to find the largest such number, and 8664 is the maximum possible permutation of those digits (8664 > 8646 > 8466 > etc.), and it satisfies divisibility, it must be the answer. We can confirm using the is_divisible tool to be safe, but it's redundant here. Still, for correctness in the ReAct loop, let's verify divisibility explicitly.\nACTION: is_divisible 8664",
