    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is given as 4312, which suggests that 4312 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum permutation divisible by 8). But I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, I can check if 4312 is divisible by 8 using `is_divisible`. If yes, and it's the maximum permutation (since digits sorted descending is 4321, and 4312 is close), then likely it's the answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should use `best_divisible` if it directly gives the maximum divisible number, or otherwise check permutations.\n\nLet\u2019s recall: A number is divisible by 8 if",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. The digits are [4, 1, 2, 3], and the oracle_max is 4312. Let\u2019s verify if 4312 is divisible by 8. The last three digits are 312. 312 \u00f7 8 = 39, so yes, 312 is divisible by 8, hence 4312 is divisible by 8. Also, 4312 is a permutation of [4,1,2,3], and among permutations starting with 4 (the largest digit), 43xx is the highest possible prefix (since next digit 3 is the largest remaining after 4), and among 43xx, 4312 is higher than 4321?

Also, 4312 is a permutation of [4,1,2,3], and among all permutations starting with 4 (the largest digit), the next largest digit is 3, giving 43xx. Among 43xx permutations, the descending order would be 4321, 4312, 4231, etc. Since 4321 is not divisible by 8 (last three digits 321 \u00f7 8 = 40.125), we check 4312 next \u2014 and it",
