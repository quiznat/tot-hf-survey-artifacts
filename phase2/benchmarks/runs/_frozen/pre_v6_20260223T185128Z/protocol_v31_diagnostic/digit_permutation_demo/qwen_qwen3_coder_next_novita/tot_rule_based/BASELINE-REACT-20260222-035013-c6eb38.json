    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 0, 7, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9750. Let's verify if 9750 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2: last digit is 0 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits = 9 + 7 + 5 + 0 = 21, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 9750 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says 9750 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9750. Let's confirm using the tools:",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states that the maximum possible number is 9750. We verified that 9750 uses all digits [9, 0, 7, 5] exactly once, ends in 0 (so divisible by 2), and digit sum is 21 (divisible by 3), hence divisible by 6. To be thorough, we should confirm using the `is_divisible` tool that 9750 is indeed divisible by 6, and optionally check if any larger permutation exists \u2014 but since 9750 is the largest permutation of those digits (9 > 7 > 5 > 0), and the oracle confirms it's the max, no need to check others. Still, using the tool validates correctness.\nACTION: is_divisible 9750 6",
