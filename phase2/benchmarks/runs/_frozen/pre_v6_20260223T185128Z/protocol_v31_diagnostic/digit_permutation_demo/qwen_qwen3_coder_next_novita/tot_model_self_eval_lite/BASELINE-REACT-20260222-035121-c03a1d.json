    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is 4319, which is the maximum possible number formed by those digits (since digits sorted descending are 9, 4, 3, 1 \u2192 9431? Wait, but oracle_max is given as 4319 \u2014 that suggests maybe the digits must be used in the order given? Or perhaps the oracle_max is just an upper bound. Let's double-check: digits are [4, 3, 9, 1]; permutations include 4319, 4391, 4931, etc. 4319 is one permutation, and likely the largest divisible by 7 \u2264 max permutation.\n\nWe have two tools: `is_divisible(n,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 4319, which is itself a permutation of the digits. Since 4319 is the maximum *divisible* candidate (as implied by \"oracle_max\"), it's likely the answer \u2014 but we must verify using the tools. We have two tools: `is_divisible(n, divisor)` and `best_divisible(digits, divisor)`. Since `best_divisible` likely returns the largest number directly, we should use that first for efficiency. Let's call `best_divisible([4,3,9,1], 7)`.\nACTION: best_divisible [4, 3, 9, 1] 7",
