    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [2, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6525. Let's verify if 6525 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 6525 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, the digits of 6525 are [6,5,2,5], which matches the multiset of given digits [2,5,6,5]. So 6525 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 6525. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools: first check if",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle claims the maximum is 6525. To verify, I need to confirm two things: (1) 6525 uses exactly the digits [2,5,6,5], and (2) 6525 is divisible by 5. Since 6525 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5 \u2014 this can be checked with `is_divisible`. Also, the digits of 6525 are [6,5,2,5], which matches the multiset [2,5,6,5]. So 6525 is valid. But to follow the ReAct protocol, I should use the tools to verify divisibility and possibly confirm it's the maximum via `best_divisible`. Let's first check divisibility of 6525 by 5 using `is_divisible`.\nACTION: is_divisible 652",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The tool `is_divisible` returned \"no\" for input 652 \u2014 but that\u2019s because the tool likely expects the full number and divisor, or perhaps the input format is different. Since the divisor is 5, and 6525 ends in 5, it *is* divisible by 5. The tool may have misinterpreted \"652\" as the number (missing the final 5). Let me try again with the full number 6525 and divisor 5. The correct call should be `is_divisible 6525 5`. However, looking at the available tools, `is_divisible` likely takes only the number as input and assumes the divisor is known (but the task says divisor=5 is given). Alternatively, maybe `is_divisible` expects just the number and internally uses the divisor from context \u2014 but then why did it return \"no\"?",
    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: The tool `is_divisible` likely expects only the number as input, and uses the divisor from the task context (divisor=5). Since 6525 ends in 5, it *must* be divisible by 5 \u2014 the earlier \"no\" response for \"652\" was due to an incomplete number (missing the final digit). I should retry with the full number 6525. Alternatively, `best_divisible` might directly return the largest valid number given the digits and divisor, which would be ideal. Let\u2019s use `best_divisible` with the digits [2,5,6,5] and divisor 5 \u2014 that tool likely handles permutation and divisibility internally.\nACTION: best_divisible [2,5,6,5] 5",
