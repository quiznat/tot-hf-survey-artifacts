    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [7, 5, 3, 5] that is divisible by 11, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 7535. Let's verify if 7535 is divisible by 11. The divisibility rule for 11 is: subtract and add digits alternately and check if the result is divisible by 11. For 7535: 7 - 5 + 3 - 5 = 0, and 0 is divisible by 11, so 7535 is divisible by 11. Since the oracle says 7535 is the maximum, and it's divisible by 11, that must be the answer. I can confirm using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 7535 11",
