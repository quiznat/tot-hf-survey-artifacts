    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 8 that can be formed by rearranging the digits [1, 2, 4, 1]. The oracle_max is given as 4112, which suggests that 4112 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible number formed from those digits and divisible by 8). Let's verify:  \n- Digits: [1, 2, 4, 1] \u2192 possible permutations include 4112, 4121, 4211, 2411, etc.  \n- 4112 \u00f7 8 = 514 \u2192 exact division, so 4112 is divisible by 8.  \n- Is 4112 the largest possible? The largest permutation of [1,2,4,1] is 4211",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 4112, and we need to verify if it's indeed the maximum number divisible by 8 that can be formed from digits [1, 2, 4, 1]. First, list all unique permutations of [1,2,4,1] in descending order and check divisibility by 8. The largest permutation is 4211, then 4121, then 4112, then 2411, etc. We should check divisibility starting from the largest. Let's use the is_divisible tool to test 4211 first. If not divisible, try next largest, etc. Since oracle_max is 4112, likely 4211 and 4121 are not divisible by 8. Let's verify using is_divisible.\nACTION: is_divisible 4211",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: 4211 is not divisible by 8. Next, check the next largest permutation: 4121. If that\u2019s not divisible, then try 4112 (which matches the oracle_max). Let\u2019s verify 4121 using is_divisible.\nACTION: is_divisible 4121",
    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: 4121 is not divisible by 8. The next largest permutation is 4112, which matches the oracle_max. Since 4112 is divisible by 8 (as 4112 \u00f7 8 = 514, an integer), and both larger permutations (4211 and 4121) are not divisible by 8, 4112 must be the maximum divisible number. Let's verify with is_divisible to be thorough.\nACTION: is_divisible 4112",
    "STEP 4 OBSERVATION: yes"
