    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [2, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6525. Let's verify if 6525 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 6525 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, 6525 uses digits 6, 5, 2, 5 \u2014 which matches the available digits [2, 5, 6, 5]. So 6525 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's divisible by 5, it's likely the answer. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools. Let's use",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle claims the maximum is 6525. Digits of 6525 are [6,5,2,5], matching the input digits [2,5,6,5]. It ends in 5, so divisible by 5. To be rigorous, I should verify using the `is_divisible` tool that 6525 is divisible by 5, and possibly check if any larger permutation exists (but 6525 is already the largest possible permutation of those digits: sorted descending is [6,5,5,2] \u2192 6552, but 6552 ends in 2 \u2192 not divisible by 5; next is 6525). So 6525 is indeed the largest valid. Let's confirm divisibility.\nACTION: is_divisible 6525 5",
