    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9852. Let's verify if 9852 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits of 9852 are 52. 52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so 52 is divisible by 4, meaning 9852 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle_max is 9852 and it's divisible by 4, and it's the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending), then 9852 is the answer. I can confirm using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 9",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The observation says \"no\" to is_divisible 9 \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make sense, because we were checking divisibility by 4, not 9. It seems the tool call was mis-specified: `is_divisible 9` likely checks divisibility by 9, not 4. The correct check is for divisibility by 4. I need to call `is_divisible` with the correct divisor, which is 4, and the number 9852. However, the available tools are `best_divisible` and `is_divisible` \u2014 likely `is_divisible` takes two arguments: number and divisor. Let me re-check the format. Since the task says \"divisor\": 4, and the oracle_max is 9852, I should call `is_divisible 9852 4`.\nACTION: is_divisible 9852",
