    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [7, 2, 4, 5] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 7542, which is the largest permutation of the digits, but we need to verify if it's divisible by 6. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation that is divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits from [7,2,4,5] are 2 or 4.\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 7+2+4+5 = 18, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 all permutations are divisible by 3",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since all permutations are divisible by 3 (sum = 18), we only need to ensure the number is even (ends in 2 or 4). The largest permutation is 7542, which ends in 2 \u2192 even \u2192 divisible by 2 and 3 \u2192 divisible by 6. So 7542 should be the answer. But we should verify using the is_divisible tool to be safe, since the oracle_max might be a hint but not guaranteed correct (though in this case it seems correct). Let's check if 7542 is divisible by 6.\nACTION: is_divisible 7542",
