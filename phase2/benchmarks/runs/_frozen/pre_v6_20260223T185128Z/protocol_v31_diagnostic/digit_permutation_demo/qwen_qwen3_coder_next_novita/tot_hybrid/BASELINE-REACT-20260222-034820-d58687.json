    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9636. Let's verify if 9636 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9636, the last two digits are 36, and 36 \u00f7 4 = 9, so 36 is divisible by 4. Therefore, 9636 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle_max is 9636 and it's divisible by 4, and it's the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending: 9,6,3,6 \u2192 9636), this must be the answer. I can confirm using",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 9636, and we need to verify if it's divisible by 4. As per the divisibility rule for 4, a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits of 9636 are 36, and 36 \u00f7 4 = 9 (no remainder), so 9636 is divisible by 4. Since 9636 is the largest possible permutation of the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] (sorted descending: 9, 6, 3, 6), and it satisfies the divisibility condition, it must be the correct answer. No further checks are needed.\nFINAL: 9636"
