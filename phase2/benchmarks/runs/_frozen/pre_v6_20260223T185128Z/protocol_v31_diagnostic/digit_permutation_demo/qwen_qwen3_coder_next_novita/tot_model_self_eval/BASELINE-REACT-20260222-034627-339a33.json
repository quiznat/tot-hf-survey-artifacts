    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 7.

Let's verify:  \n- Digits: 4, 3, 9, 1 \u2192 maximum possible number is 9431, but oracle_max is 4319, so perhaps 4319 is the largest *divisible* by 7.  \nWe can check divisibility of 4319 by 7 using the is_divisible tool.  \nAlternatively, we can use best_divisible to directly get the answer.

To confirm, I should verify if 4319 is divisible by 7 using the is_divisible tool. If yes, and it's the largest such permutation, then it's the answer. Alternatively, best_divisible may directly return the correct value. Since best_divisible is designed for this exact purpose (finding the best/max divisible number from digits), I should use it first for efficiency. Let's call best_divisible with digits [4,3,9,1] and divisor 7.\nACTION: best_divisible [4, 3, 9, 1] 7",
