    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 3, 1, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5. The oracle_max is 8315, which may or may not be divisible by 5. Let's first check if 8315 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 8315 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Since 8315 is the maximum possible number formed by these digits (digits sorted descending: 8,3,1,5 \u2192 8315), and it's divisible by 5, then it must be the answer. But let's verify using the tools to be safe. First, use is_divisible on 8315 with divisor",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 8315, formed by sorting digits [8,3,1,5] in descending order. A number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5. 8315 ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5. Since it's the largest possible permutation of the digits and already divisible by 5, it must be the answer. However, to follow the ReAct protocol and use tools as required, I should verify using is_divisible. Let's call is_divisible with 8315 and divisor 5.\nACTION: is_divisible 8315 5",
