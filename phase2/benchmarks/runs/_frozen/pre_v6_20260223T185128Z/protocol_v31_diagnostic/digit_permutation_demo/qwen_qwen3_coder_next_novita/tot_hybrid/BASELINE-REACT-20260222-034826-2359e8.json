Let\u2019s recall the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nWe need to consider permutations of [3,1,6,2] and find the maximum such number divisible by 4. Since oracle_max = 6312, that suggests 6312 is the answer \u2014 but we should verify it's divisible by 4 and uses the digits.\n\nCheck digits of 6312: 6,3,1,2 \u2014 matches [3,1,6,2] \u2713  \nCheck divisibility by 4: last two digits = 12 \u2192",
