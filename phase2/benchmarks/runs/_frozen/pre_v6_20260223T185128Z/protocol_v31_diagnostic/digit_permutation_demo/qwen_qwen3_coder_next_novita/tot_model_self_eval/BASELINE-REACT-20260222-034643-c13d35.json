    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 3, 2, 1] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max is given as 4312, which suggests that 4312 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and divisible by 11). Let's verify:  \n- 4312 \u00f7 11 = 392, and 11 \u00d7 392 = 4312 \u2192 yes, divisible.  \n- Is 4312 the largest permutation?

Next, we should check the next largest permutations in descending order. Since 4312 is given as oracle_max and we verified it's divisible by 11 (11 \u00d7 392 = 4312), and 4312 < 4321, it's plausible it's the answer. But to be rigorous, we should confirm no larger valid permutation exists between 4312 and 4321.
