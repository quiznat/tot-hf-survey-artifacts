    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [1, 2, 5, 4] and is divisible by 3. The oracle_max is given as 5421, which suggests that 5421 might be the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation of those digits), but we need to verify if it's divisible by 3. Let's first check if 5421 is divisible by 3 using the is_divisible tool. If not, we'll need to try smaller permutations.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 3: a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Sum of digits: 1+2+5+4 = 12, which is divisible by 3, so *some* permutation must be divisible by 3. Since 54",

Therefore, the largest permutation \u2014 which is 5421 \u2014 must be divisible by 3. Since the oracle_max is 5421, and all permutations are divisible by 3, 5421 is the answer. We can confirm with is_divisible(5421, 3), but logically it's guaranteed. Let's verify with the tool to be safe.",

Therefore, the largest permutation \u2014 5421 \u2014 must be divisible by 3. The oracle_max being 5421 supports this. To be thorough, I should verify using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 5421 3",
