    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9636. Let's verify if 9636 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9636, the last two digits are 36, and 36 \u00f7 4 = 9, so 36 is divisible by 4. Therefore, 9636 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says 9636 is the maximum, and it's valid, we can conclude the answer is 9636. But to be thorough, let's confirm using the tools: first check if 9636 is divisible by 4",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible number is 9636. To confirm it's valid, I need to verify it's divisible by 4. As noted, divisibility by 4 depends on the last two digits: 36 \u00f7 4 = 9, so yes, 9636 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle guarantees 9636 is the maximum, and it satisfies the divisibility condition, no further checks are needed. I can directly output the answer.\nFINAL: 9636"
