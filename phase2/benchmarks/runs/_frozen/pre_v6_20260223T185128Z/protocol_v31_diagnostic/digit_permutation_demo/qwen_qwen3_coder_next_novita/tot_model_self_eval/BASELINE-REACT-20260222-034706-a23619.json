    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [7, 2, 4, 5] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 7542, which is the largest permutation of the digits (7,5,4,2), but we need to verify if it's divisible by 6. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation that is divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits from [7,2,4,5] are 2 or 4.\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 7+2+4+5 = 18, which is divisible by 3",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since the sum of digits is 18 (divisible by 3), any permutation will be divisible by 3. So we only need to ensure the number is even (ends in 2 or 4) to be divisible by 6. The largest permutation is 7542 (ends in 2 \u2192 even), so it's divisible by both 2 and 3 \u2192 divisible by 6. Let's verify using the is_divisible tool to be safe.\nACTION: is_divisible 7542 6",
