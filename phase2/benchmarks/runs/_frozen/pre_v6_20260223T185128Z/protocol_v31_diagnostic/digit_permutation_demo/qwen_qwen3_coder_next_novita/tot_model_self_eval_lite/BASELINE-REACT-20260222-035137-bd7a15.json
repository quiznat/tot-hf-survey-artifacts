    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [7, 2, 4, 5] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 7542, which suggests that 7542 might be the correct answer, but we need to verify it using the available tools. First, I should check if 7542 is divisible by 6 using the is_divisible tool. If it is, and it's the largest possible permutation (since digits sorted descending give 7542), then it's the answer. If not, I need to find the next largest permutation and check again.\n\nLet me first verify if 7542 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. But since I have the is_divisible tool, I can directly",

To confirm it's the answer, I need to verify if 7542 is divisible by 6 using the is_divisible tool. If yes, then it's the final answer. If not, I'll need to find the next largest valid permutation.
