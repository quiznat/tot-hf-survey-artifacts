    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 6, 0] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and it's given that the oracle_max is 6300. Let's verify if 6300 is achievable with the given digits: digits of 6300 are [6, 3, 0, 0] \u2014 which matches our digits [3, 0, 6, 0] (two zeros, one 3, one 6). So 6300 is a candidate. Now check if 6300 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2: last digit is 0 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3: sum of",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3. For 6300:  \n- Divisible by 2: last digit is 0 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits = 6 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 9, and 9 is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 6300 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle_max is 6300 and the digits match, and 6300 is valid, it must be the maximum possible. We can confirm using the is_divisible tool to be thorough, but logically it's already verified. Let's use the is_divisible tool to double-check.  \nACTION: is_divisible 6300 6",
