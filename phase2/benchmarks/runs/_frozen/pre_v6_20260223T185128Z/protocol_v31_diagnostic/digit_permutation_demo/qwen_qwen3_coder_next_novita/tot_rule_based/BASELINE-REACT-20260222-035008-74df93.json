    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 2, 3, 2] that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum is 5322. Let's verify if 5322 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. For divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2014 5322 ends in 2, so OK. For divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3 \u2014 5+3+2+2 = 12, which is divisible by 3. So 5322 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says it's the max, and it's valid, the answer should be 5322. But to be thorough, maybe",
