    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 3, 7, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9732. Let's verify if 9732 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9732, the last two digits are 32, and 32 \u00f7 4 = 8, so 9732 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle_max is 9732 and it's divisible by 4, and it's the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending: 9,7,3,2), then 9732 is the answer. I can confirm using the is_divisible tool to be safe.\nACTION: is_div",
