    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 3, 8, 8] that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 8538. Let's verify if 8538 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2: last digit is 8 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits = 8+5+3+8 = 24 \u2192 24 is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 8538 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says 8538 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 8538. Let's confirm using the tools: first check if",
