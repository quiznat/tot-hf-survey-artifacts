    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle_max is 6312 (which is likely the maximum possible number from those digits). We need to use the tools best_divisible or is_divisible to find the answer.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nWe have digits [3, 1, 6, 2]. Let's list all possible 2-digit endings from these digits (without repetition) and check which are divisible by 4:\n\nPossible last two digits (order matters):\n- 31 \u2192 31 % 4 = 3 \u2192 no  \n- 36 \u2192 36 % 4 = 0 \u2192 yes",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From STEP 1, we identified that 36 is a valid ending (36 % 4 = 0). Now, to form the largest possible number, we want the largest possible prefix (remaining digits) before the ending \"36\". The digits used in \"36\" are 3 and 6, leaving [1, 2] unused. To maximize the number, we arrange the remaining digits in descending order: 21. So candidate number is 2136.\n\nBut we should verify if there are other valid 2-digit endings that could yield a larger overall number. Let's continue listing all valid 2-digit endings divisible by 4:\n\n- 12 \u2192 12 % 4 = 0 \u2192 yes  \n- 16 \u2192 16 % 4 = 0 \u2192 yes  \n- 24? Not possible (no 4)  \n- 2",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: From STEP 2, we identified valid 2-digit endings: 36, 12, and 16. Let's list all valid endings and corresponding max prefixes:\n\n- Ending 36: remaining digits [1,2] \u2192 max prefix = 21 \u2192 number = 2136  \n- Ending 12: remaining digits [3,6] \u2192 max prefix = 63 \u2192 number = 6312  \n- Ending 16: remaining digits [3,2] \u2192 max prefix = 32 \u2192 number = 3216  \n\nNow compare candidates: 6312, 3216, 2136. Clearly 6312 is largest. Also, oracle_max = 6312, which matches the candidate from ending 12. So 6312 is likely the answer. But we",

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: We have identified candidate numbers from valid 2-digit endings divisible by 4: 6312 (ending 12), 3216 (ending 16), and 2136 (ending 36). 6312 is the largest and matches the oracle_max, suggesting it is divisible by 4. To confirm, we should use the is_divisible tool to verify that 6312 is divisible by 4 before concluding.\nACTION: is_divisible 6312",
