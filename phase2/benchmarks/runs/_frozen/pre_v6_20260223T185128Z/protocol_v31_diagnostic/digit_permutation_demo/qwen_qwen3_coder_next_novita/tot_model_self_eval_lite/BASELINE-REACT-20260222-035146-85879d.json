    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number \u2264 9023 that can be formed using the digits [0, 9, 2, 3] (each used at most once) and is divisible by 7. We have two tools: `is_divisible(n, d)` to check divisibility, and `best_divisible(digits, divisor, max_val)` which likely solves the problem directly. Since `best_divisible` is available and likely implements the full logic, and the input matches its expected parameters (digits, divisor, max_val), the most efficient approach is to call `best_divisible` directly.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [0, 9, 2, 3] 7 9023",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 9023",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The tool `best_divisible` returned 9023 directly. However, we must verify whether 9023 is actually formable using the digits [0, 9, 2, 3] (each used at most once). Let's check: 9023 uses digits 9, 0, 2, 3 \u2014 exactly the given digits, each once. So it's a valid permutation. Now, is it divisible by 7? We should verify using `is_divisible` to be safe, since the tool might have returned the max value without checking divisibility (though its name suggests it does). Let's double-check.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 9023 7",
