    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 0, 7, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 9750. Let\u2019s verify if 9750 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 iff it\u2019s divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2? 9750 ends in 0 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3? Sum of digits = 9 + 7 + 5 + 0 = 21 \u2192 21 is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 9750 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle_max is given as 9750, and it's a valid number using the digits, and it's the maximum possible",
