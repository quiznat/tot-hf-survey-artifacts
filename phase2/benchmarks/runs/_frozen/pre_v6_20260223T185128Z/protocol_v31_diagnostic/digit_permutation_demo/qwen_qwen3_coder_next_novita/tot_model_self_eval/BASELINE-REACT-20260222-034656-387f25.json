    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and we are told the oracle_max is 9444. Since 9444 is the maximum possible number with those digits (digits sorted descending: 9, 4, 4, 4), we should first check if 9444 is divisible by 6. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 last digit must be 4 (only even digit available).\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3.

The remaining digits after fixing last digit as 4 are [4, 4, 9], and the largest arrangement of those is 944. So the largest valid number is 9444.
