    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 9852. Let\u2019s recall the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nWe need to consider permutations of the digits to form the largest possible number divisible by 4. Since 9852 is given as oracle_max, it's likely the correct answer, but let\u2019s verify.\n\nFirst, check if 9852 is divisible by 4: last two digits are 52. 52 \u00f7 4 = 13 \u2192 yes, divisible.\n\nNow, is 9852 the largest possible permutation? The digits sorted descending are [9,8,5,2], so",
