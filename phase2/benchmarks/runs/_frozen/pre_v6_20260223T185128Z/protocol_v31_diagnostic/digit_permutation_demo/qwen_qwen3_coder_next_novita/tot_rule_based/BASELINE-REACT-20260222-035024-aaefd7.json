    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [5, 3, 8, 8] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 8538, which suggests that 8538 might be the correct answer, but I need to verify it using the available tools. First, I should check if 8538 is divisible by 6 using the is_divisible tool. If it is, and it's the maximum possible permutation (since digits sorted descending give 8853, but 8538 is less than that \u2014 maybe 8853 isn\u2019t divisible by 6), then 8538 could be the answer. But I need to verify.\n\nLet me first check if 8538 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3. For divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even \u2014 8538 ends in 8, so that's good. For divisibility by 3, the sum of digits must be divisible by 3: 8 + 5 + 3 + 8 = 24, and 24 \u00f7 3 = 8, so yes \u2014 divisible by 3. So 8538 is divisible by 6. Now, is it the maximum possible? Let's consider permutations of [5, 3, 8, 8] in descending order: 8853, 8835, 8583, 8538, 8385, 8358, etc. We need to check if any larger permutation",

Now, is it the maximum possible? Permutations of [5,3,8,8] in descending order: 8853, 8835, 8583, 8538, ... Let\u2019s check if any larger permutation is divisible by 6. First, 8853: ends in 3 (odd) \u2192 not divisible by 2 \u2192 discard. Next, 8835: ends in 5 (odd) \u2192 not divisible by 2 \u2192 discard. Next, 8583: ends in 3 (odd)",
