    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 2] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is 9420, which is likely the maximum possible number from those digits (9420 = 9*1000 + 4*100 + 2*10 + 0). But 9420 may or may not be divisible by 6. We need to check divisibility by 6, which requires divisibility by both 2 and 3.\n\nDivisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 0, 2, 4 (we have 0, 2, 4). So any candidate ending in 0, 2, or 4 is even.\n\nDivisibility by 3:",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: To be divisible by 6, a number must be divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 candidates must end in 0, 2, or 4 (we have all three).  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 15, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 *any* permutation of these digits is divisible by 3.  \nSo the problem reduces to finding the *largest* permutation of [9,4,0,2] that ends in an even digit (0, 2, or 4).  \n\nThe largest possible permutation is 9420 (ends in 0 \u2192 even), and since sum = 15 is divisible by 3, 9420 is divisible",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Since the sum of digits is 15 (divisible by 3), all permutations are divisible by 3. For divisibility by 6, we also need evenness \u2192 last digit must be 0, 2, or 4. The largest permutation is 9420, ending in 0 (even), so it satisfies both conditions. The oracle_max is 9420, and it's divisible by 6. We should verify with the is_divisible tool to be safe.\nACTION: is_divisible 9420 6",
