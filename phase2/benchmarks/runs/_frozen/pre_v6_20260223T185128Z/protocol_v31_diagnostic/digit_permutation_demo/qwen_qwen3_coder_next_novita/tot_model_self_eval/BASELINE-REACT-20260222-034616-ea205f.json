    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by rearranging the digits [3, 0, 6, 0] (using all digits exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6300. Let's verify and find the answer.\n\nFirst, recall: A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 0, 6 (since digits are [3,0,6,0]).\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 3 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 9 \u2192 divisible by 3, so any permutation is divisible by 3.\n\nSo we only need to ensure last digit is even (0 or 6),",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: We need the maximum number formed by permuting [3, 0, 6, 0] divisible by 6. Since sum = 9 (divisible by 3), only need last digit even (0 or 6). To maximize, prefer larger digits leftmost. Try descending permutations: 6300 (ends with 0 \u2192 even), check if divisible by 6. Since divisible by 3 (sum=9) and even, yes. Oracle says max is 6300, so likely 6300 is the answer. Let's verify using tools.\nACTION: is_divisible 6300\n6300",
