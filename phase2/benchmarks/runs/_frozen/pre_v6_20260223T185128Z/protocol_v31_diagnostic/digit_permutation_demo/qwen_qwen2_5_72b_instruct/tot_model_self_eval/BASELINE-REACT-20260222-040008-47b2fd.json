    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task requires finding if there is a number that can be formed from the given digits [6, 6, 3, 4] which is divisible by 7 and does not exceed 6643. I will start by attempting to form numbers from the given digits and check their divisibility by 7 using the `is_divisible` tool. If a valid number is found, I can return it immediately. If not, I'll consider using the `best_divisible` tool to find the closest valid number.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 6634 7",
