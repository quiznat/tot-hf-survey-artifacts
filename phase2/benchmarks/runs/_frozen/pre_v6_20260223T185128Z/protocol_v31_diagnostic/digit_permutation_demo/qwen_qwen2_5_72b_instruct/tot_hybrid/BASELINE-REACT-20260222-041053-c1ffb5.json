    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the given divisor, and it should not exceed the oracle_max value. We should first try to form the largest possible number from the given digits and then check if it is divisible by the divisor. If not, we need to adjust the number downwards, ensuring it remains within the constraints.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {'digits': [5, 8, 8, 4], 'divisor': 7, 'max_value': 5488}",
