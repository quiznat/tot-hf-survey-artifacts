    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find the largest number that can be made from the given digits which is divisible by the given divisor and does not exceed the oracle_max value. The best way to start is by attempting to generate numbers from the digits in descending order of their size, then check if they are divisible by the divisor. If not, I will try with the next possible combination.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {'digits': [0, 4, 2, 1], 'max_value': 4102, 'divisor': 7}",
