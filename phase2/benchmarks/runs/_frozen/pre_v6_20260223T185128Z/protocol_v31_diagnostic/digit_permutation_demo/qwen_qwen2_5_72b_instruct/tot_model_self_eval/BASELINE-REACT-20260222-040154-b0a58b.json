However, we also have an upper limit of 9023 due to the `oracle_max` constraint. I will generate the largest number less than or equal to 9023 that can be formed from the digits and check its divisibility by 7.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [0, 9, 2, 3] 7 9023\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: 9023\nTHINK: The function `best_divisible` has returned 9023, which means this is the largest number that can be formed from the digits [0, 9, 2, 3], does not exceed the `oracle_max` of 9023, and is divisible by 7.",
