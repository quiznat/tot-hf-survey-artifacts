    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the provided divisor and does not exceed the oracle maximum value. I will start by trying to form the largest possible number with the given digits and then check if it is divisible by the divisor. If not, I will adjust the number accordingly.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 0, 8, 5], \"max_value\": 5803, \"divisor\": 7}",

Since this meets all the criteria (formed using the given digits, does not exceed the oracle maximum, and is divisible by the divisor), I can conclude that this is the answer.\n\nFINAL: 5803"
