    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the provided divisor and does not exceed the oracle_max value. I should start by generating the largest possible number from the digits and then check if it is divisible by the divisor. If not, I will decrease the number until I find one that meets all the conditions.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [6, 9, 9, 5], \"divisor\": 5, \"oracle_max\": 9965}",

Since 9965 is already at the limit and is supposed to be divisible by the divisor (5), I will verify if 9965 is indeed divisible by 5 using the is_divisible tool.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 9965, \"divisor\": 5}",
