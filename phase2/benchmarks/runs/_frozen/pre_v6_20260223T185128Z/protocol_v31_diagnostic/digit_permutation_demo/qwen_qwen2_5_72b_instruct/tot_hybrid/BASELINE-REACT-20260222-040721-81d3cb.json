    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to determine if there's a combination of the given digits that forms a number divisible by the divisor and does not exceed the maximum allowed value (oracle_max). First, I should check if any single digit is already divisible by the divisor.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 8 5\n\nACTION: is_divisible 5 5\n\nACTION: is_divisible 2 3\n\nACTION: is_divisible 3 5\n\nTHINK: Since none of the digits alone satisfy the condition, I will now try combinations of these digits to see if they form a number that is divisible by the divisor and within the limit. I'll start with two-digit combinations.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [8, 5, 2, 3] 5 8325 2\n\nTHINK: If no valid two-digit number is found, I will move on to three-digit and then",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Given the observation from the previous action, it appears a valid combination has been found. The number 8325 is within the oracle_max limit and is divisible by 5. However, since the digits provided are [8, 5, 2, 3], and 8325 is a four-digit number, it must be verified whether 8325 can be formed using the given digits. Given that the digits match, we can confirm that 8325 is a valid solution.\n\nFINAL: 8325"
