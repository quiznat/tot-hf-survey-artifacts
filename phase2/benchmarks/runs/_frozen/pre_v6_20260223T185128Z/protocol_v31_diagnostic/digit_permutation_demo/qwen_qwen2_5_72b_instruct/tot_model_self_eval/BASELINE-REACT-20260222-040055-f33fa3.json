    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since the number 2565 is divisible by 5, there's no need to use the `best_divisible` tool as the condition is already met. However, I should verify if this number does not exceed the `oracle_max` value of 6525 before concluding.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 6525 5\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: yes\nTHINK: The `oracle_max` value 6525 is also divisible by 5, but the main concern is whether the number we formed (2565) exceeds 6525. Since 2565 is less than 6525, it meets all the criteria.\n\nFINAL: 2565",
