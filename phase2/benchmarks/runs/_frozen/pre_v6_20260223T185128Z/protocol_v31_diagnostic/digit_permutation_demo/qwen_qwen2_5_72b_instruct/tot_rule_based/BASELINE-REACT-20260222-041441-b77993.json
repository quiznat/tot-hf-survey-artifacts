    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task requires finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the provided divisor (7 in this case) and does not exceed the oracle_max value (5488). We should start by generating potential numbers from the digits and checking their divisibility and constraints.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [5, 8, 8, 4], \"divisor\": 7, \"max_value\": 5488}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function has returned 5488, which is within the constraints and divisible by 7. However, we need to ensure that this number can indeed be formed from the given digits [5, 8, 8, 4]. Let's check if 5488 can be formed from these digits.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 5488 7\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: true\nTHINK: 5488 is divisible by 7, but we still need to verify if it can be formed from the digits [5, 8, 8, 4]. Since 5488 is the maximum value allowed, let's check if there is any permutation of [5, 8, 8, 4] that equals 5488.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [5, 8,",
