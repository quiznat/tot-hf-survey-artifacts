    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the provided divisor (4 in this case). The oracle_max value might represent an upper limit or an example of a correct answer if the digits were 9, 7, 3, and 2. However, since we need to confirm whether this number is indeed divisible by 4 and if it's the largest possible number formed from the given digits, I will start by checking if 9732 is divisible by 4.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 9732 4",
