    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number divisible by a given divisor (8 in this case) that can be formed from the provided digits [0, 4, 9, 8] and is less than or equal to the `oracle_max` value (9840). I should start by attempting to form the largest possible number with the digits and then check if it's divisible by 8. If not, I will try to find a smaller number that meets the criteria.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [0, 4, 9, 8], \"divisor\": 8, \"upper_bound\": 9840}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function has returned 9840, which means that 9840 is the largest number formed from the digits [0, 4, 9, 8] that is divisible by 8 and does not exceed the `oracle_max` value. Since 9840 is within the limit and meets all the criteria, it is the correct answer.\n\nFINAL: 9840"
