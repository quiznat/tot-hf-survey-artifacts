    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve checking if a number formed by the given digits is divisible by the provided divisor. I should start by trying to form the largest possible number with the given digits and then check its divisibility by the divisor. If it's not divisible or exceeds the oracle_max, I'll need to try other combinations.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [6, 8, 4, 6], \"divisor\": 3, \"oracle_max\": 8664}",
