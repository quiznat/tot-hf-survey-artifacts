    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is not clearly defined in terms of what the expected output is. However, based on the available tools `best_divisible` and `is_divisible`, and the given inputs, it seems like the goal might be to find the best number from the list of digits that is divisible by the divisor or check if any combination of the digits can form a number that is divisible by the divisor. Since `oracle_max` is provided, it might be a constraint for the largest number we can consider. Let's start by checking if any single digit is divisible by the divisor using the `is_divisible` tool.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 1 8\n\nACTION: is_divisible 2 8\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4 8\n\nACTION: is_divisible 1 8\n\nTHINK: Since none of the individual digits are divisible by 8, let's try forming numbers from the digits and see",
