    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 2, 4, 4] that is divisible by 7. Since I want the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order to form the largest possible number first, then check if it's divisible by 7. If not, I'll need to try other arrangements.\n\nLet me start by trying to form the largest number with these digits and check divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 2, 4, 4], \"divisor\": 7}\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The available tools are `best_divisible` and `is_divisible`. Let me think about this more systematically.\n\nFirst, I should understand what these tools do:\n- `best_divisible`: This likely finds the best (largest) number divisible by the given divisor\n- `is_divisible`:",
