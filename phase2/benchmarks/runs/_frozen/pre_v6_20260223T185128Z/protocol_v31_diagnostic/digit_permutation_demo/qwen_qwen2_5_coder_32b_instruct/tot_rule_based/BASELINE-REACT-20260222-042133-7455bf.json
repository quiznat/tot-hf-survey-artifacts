The oracle_max of 4319 suggests an upper bound, but I should check if there's a larger valid number.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits and check which ones are divisible by 7.\n\nThe available digits are 4, 3, 9, 1. I can form various 4-digit numbers with these digits.\n\nLet me try to find the maximum possible number first - that would be 9431. But I need to check divisibility by 7.\n\nSince I have two tools available:\n- best_divisible: This might help find the best divisible number\n- is_divisible: This checks if a specific number is divisible\n\nI'll start by trying to form numbers systematically and check divisibility",

Since I want the largest number, I should try to arrange the digits in descending order first (9431) and work my way down through permutations until I find one divisible by 7.\n\nHowever, I notice I don't have a direct tool to generate all permutations or check divisibility of large numbers directly. Let me think about this differently.\n\nThe oracle_max of 4319 suggests that any valid answer must be \u2264 4319. So I'm looking for the largest number \u2264 4319 that uses exactly the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] once each and is divisible by 7.\n\nLet me try to use the available tools strategically.
