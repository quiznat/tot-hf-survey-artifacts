    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [7, 5, 3, 5] that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max constraint tells me the answer should not exceed 7535.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 7, 5, 3, 5. I can arrange them in different orders to create different 4-digit numbers.\n\nTo check divisibility by 11, I'll use the rule: a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of digits in odd positions and the sum of digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including 0).\n\nLet me try to construct the largest possible number first, then work down until I find one divisible by 11, or use the tool to check directly.\n\nThe largest arrangement would be",
