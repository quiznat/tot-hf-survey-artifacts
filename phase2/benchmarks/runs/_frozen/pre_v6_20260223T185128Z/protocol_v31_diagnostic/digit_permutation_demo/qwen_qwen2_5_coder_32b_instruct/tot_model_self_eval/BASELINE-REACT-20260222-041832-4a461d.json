    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [7, 5, 3, 5] that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max constraint tells me the answer cannot exceed 7535. \n\nFirst, I should check what numbers can be formed and test their divisibility by 11. Since I want the largest possible number under 7535, I should try arrangements that start with the highest digits.\n\nLet me first try to form the largest possible number with these digits: 7553. But I need to check if this is divisible by 11, or if there's a smaller arrangement that works.\n\nActually, let me approach this systematically using the available tools. I'll use best_divisible to find the best divisible number, but I need to make sure I'm working within the constraints.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [7,",
