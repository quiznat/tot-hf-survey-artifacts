    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 8, 5] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max of 5803 suggests there's an upper limit, but I should first find the largest possible arrangement of these digits and then check divisibility.\n\nLet me first arrange the digits in descending order to get the largest possible number: 8530. Then I'll check if this is divisible by 7, and if not, I'll try other arrangements systematically.\n\nActually, let me use the available tools more systematically. First, I should check what numbers can be made with these digits and see which ones are divisible by 7.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 0, 8, 5], \"divisor\": 7}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The tool returned 5803 as the best divisible number. Let me verify this is correct by checking if 5803 is actually divisible by 7 and if it can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 8, 5].\n\nFirst, let me check if 5803 is divisible by 7:\n5803 \u00f7 7 = 829 (exact division)\n\nNow let me verify if 5803 can be formed using digits [3, 0, 8, 5]:\nThe number 5803 contains digits: 5, 8, 0, 3 - which are exactly the digits we have.\n\nSince 5803 is divisible by 7 and can be formed using our given digits, this appears to be the answer.\n\nFINAL: 5803"
