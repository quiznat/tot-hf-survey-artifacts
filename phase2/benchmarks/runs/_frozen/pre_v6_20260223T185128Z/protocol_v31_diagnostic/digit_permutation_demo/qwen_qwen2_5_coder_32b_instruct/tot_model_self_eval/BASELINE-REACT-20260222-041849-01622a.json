    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 9, 8, 0] that is divisible by 4 and is less than or equal to 9800.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with digits [0, 9, 8, 0]. The possible arrangements are:\n- 9800\n- 9080\n- 9008\n- 8900\n- 8090\n- 8009\n- 0980 (invalid - starts with 0)\n- 0908 (invalid - starts with 0)\n- 0890 (invalid - starts with 0)\n- 0809 (invalid - starts with 0)\n- 0098 (invalid - starts with 0)\n- 0",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 9, 8, 0] that is divisible by 4 and is less than or equal to 9800.\n\nFrom my analysis, the valid arrangements (not starting with 0) are:\n- 9800\n- 9080\n- 9008\n- 8900\n- 8090\n- 8009\n\nNow I need to check which of these are divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check each:\n- 9800: last two digits 00 \u2192 0 is divisible by 4 \u2713\n- 9080: last two digits 80 \u2192 80 is divisible by 4 \u2713",

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I have identified the valid numbers formed by the digits [0, 9, 8, 0] that are divisible by 4 and less than or equal to 9800. These are: 9800, 9080, 9008, and 8009. However, 8009 was incorrectly included earlier; it's not divisible by 4 as shown in the previous step. So the correct list is: 9800, 9080, 9008, and 8900. Among these, the largest is 9800. Let me verify this using the available tools to ensure accuracy.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 9800 4",
