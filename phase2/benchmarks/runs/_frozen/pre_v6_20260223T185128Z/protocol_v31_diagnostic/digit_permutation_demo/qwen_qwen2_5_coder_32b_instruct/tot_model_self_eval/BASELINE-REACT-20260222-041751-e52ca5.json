    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 0, 3, 4] that is divisible by 5. The oracle_max constraint is 4300, so the answer must not exceed this value.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 5: it must end in 0 or 5. Looking at my available digits [0, 0, 3, 4], I can only use 0 to make a number divisible by 5 (since there's no 5 in the digits).\n\nSo I need to form the largest possible number \u2264 4300 using these digits that ends in 0.\n\nLet me think about how to arrange the digits [0, 0, 3, 4] to create the largest valid number:\n1. The number must end in 0 (to be divisible by 5)\n2",

The available digits are 0, 0, 3, 4. Since I must end with 0, I should place the remaining digits (0, 3, 4) in descending order for the first three positions.\n\nThe largest arrangement would be 4300, but I need to check if this is actually achievable with the given constraints.\n\nLet me try to form numbers systematically:\n- 4",
