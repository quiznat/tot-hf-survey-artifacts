Since I want the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order first, then check divisibility and adjust if necessary.\n\nLet me start by trying to form the largest possible number with these digits, which would be 4432, and check if it's divisible by 7.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4432 7\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The oracle_max is 2443, so I need to find a number \u2264 2443 that uses the given digits and is divisible by 7.\n\nLet me think about this systematically:\n1.
