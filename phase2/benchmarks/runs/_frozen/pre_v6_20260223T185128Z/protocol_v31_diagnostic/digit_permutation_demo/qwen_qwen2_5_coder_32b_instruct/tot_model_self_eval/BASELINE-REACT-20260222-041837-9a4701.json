    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 4312. \n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n1. I need to create numbers using all four digits [4, 1, 2, 3] exactly once\n2. Check which of these numbers are divisible by 8\n3. Among those, find the largest one that doesn't exceed 4312\n\nSince I have 4 digits, there are 4! = 24 possible arrangements. However, I can use the tools to help narrow this down systematically.\n\nLet me first try",
