    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 4, 9, 3] that is divisible by 7. Since I'm looking for the maximum value, I should arrange the digits in descending order first (9, 4, 3, 3) and check if that number is divisible by 7. If not, I'll need to try other arrangements.\n\nLet me start by checking if 9433 is divisible by 7 using the is_divisible tool.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 9433 7\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The oracle_max is 3934, which means I should look for numbers up to 3934. So I need to find the largest number \u2264 3934 that can be formed with these digits and is divisible by 7.\n\nLet me think about this systematically. First,",
