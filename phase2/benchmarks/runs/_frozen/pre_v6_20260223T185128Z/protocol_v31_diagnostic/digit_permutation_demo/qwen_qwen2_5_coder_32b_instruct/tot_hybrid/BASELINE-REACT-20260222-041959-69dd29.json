    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 0, 9, 5] that is divisible by 5. \n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 5: a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is either 0 or 5.\n\nLooking at my available digits [6, 0, 9, 5], I can use either 0 or 5 as the last digit to make the number divisible by 5.\n\nTo create the largest possible number, I should:\n1. Use the largest available digit as the last digit (which would be 5)\n2. Arrange the remaining digits in descending order for the rest of the number\n\nSo I'll arrange [6, 0, 9] in descending order: 9, 6, 0\nThis gives me 9605.\n\nBut",
