    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 6, 0] that is divisible by 6. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 6:\n- A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it's divisible by both 2 and 3\n- For divisibility by 2: the last digit must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)\n- For divisibility by 3: the sum of all digits must be divisible by 3\n\nLet me check the sum of the available digits: 3 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 9\nSince 9 is divisible by 3, any arrangement of these digits will satisfy the divisibility by 3 condition.\n\nFor divisibility by 2, I need the last",

For divisibility by 6: the number must be divisible by both 2 and 3\n2. For divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3\n3. For divisibility by 2: last digit must be even\n\nSum of digits: 3 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 9, which is divisible by 3, so any arrangement satisfies the divisibility by 3 condition.\n\nFor divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even. From my digits [3, 0, 6, 0], the even digits are 0 and 6.\n\nTo form the largest possible number, I want the highest digits in the leftmost positions",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: To maximize the number, I should arrange the digits in descending order, but I need to ensure the last digit is even for divisibility by 2. The available digits are [3, 0, 6, 0]. \n\nThe even digits are 0 and 6. To get the largest number, I should place the largest digits first, but the last digit must be even. \n\nIf I put 6 as the last digit, the remaining digits [3, 0, 0] arranged in descending order would be 300. So I'd have 3006.\n\nIf I put 0 as the last digit, the remaining digits [3, 0, 6] arranged in descending order would be 630. So I'd have 6300.\n\nComparing 3006 and 6300, the larger number is 630",
