    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max of 4319 suggests this is a constraint on the maximum value I should consider.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have 4 digits: 4, 3, 9, 1. I can arrange them in different orders to create different 4-digit numbers.\n\nSince I want the largest possible number that's divisible by 7, I should start by trying arrangements that form larger numbers first. The largest arrangement would be 9431, but I need to check if it's divisible by 7.\n\nLet me use the tools available to check divisibility and find the best divisible number.\nACTION: is_divisible 9431 7",
