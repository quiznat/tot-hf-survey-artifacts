    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 3] that is divisible by 4 and does not exceed 5360.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 5, 6, 0, 3. I can arrange them in different orders to create various 4-digit numbers.\n\nTo be divisible by 4, a number must have its last two digits forming a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me first check which pairs of digits from {5, 6, 0, 3} can form numbers divisible by 4 when placed at the end:\n- 03: 3 % 4 = 3 (not divisible)\n- 05: 5 % 4 = 1 (not divisible)\n- 06: 6 % 4",
