    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 7, 2] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 9732.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check all possible 4-digit combinations of the given digits and see which ones are divisible by 4, keeping in mind the oracle_max constraint.\n\nThe available digits are: 9, 3, 7, 2\n\nTo maximize the number, I should try to arrange these digits in descending order first, but also ensure the resulting number is divisible by 4.\n\nLet me use the best_divisible tool to help me find the optimal solution.\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [9",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I've used the best_divisible tool and it returned 9732. Let me verify this is correct by checking if 9732 is divisible by 4 and uses the given digits.\n\nThe digits used are 9, 7, 3, 2 - which matches our available digits [9, 3, 7, 2].\n\nFor divisibility by 4, I need to check if the last two digits (32) are divisible by 4.\n32 \u00f7 4 = 8, so 32 is divisible by 4.\n\nSince 9732 is divisible by 4 and uses all the required digits, and it's less than or equal to the oracle_max of 9732, this appears to be the correct answer.\n\nFINAL: 9732"
