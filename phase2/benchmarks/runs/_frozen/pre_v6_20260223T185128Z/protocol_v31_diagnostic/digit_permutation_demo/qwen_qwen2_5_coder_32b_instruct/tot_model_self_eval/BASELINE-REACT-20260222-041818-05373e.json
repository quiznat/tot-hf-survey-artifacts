    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 0, 9, 5] that is divisible by 5. \n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 5: a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is either 0 or 5.\n\nLooking at my available digits [6, 0, 9, 5], I can use either 0 or 5 as the last digit to make the number divisible by 5.\n\nTo create the largest possible number, I want the highest digits in the leftmost positions. So I should arrange the remaining digits (excluding the one used as the last digit) in descending order.\n\nIf I use 0 as the last digit, the remaining digits are [6, 9, 5]. Arranged in descending order: 965. So the number would be 9",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me continue my analysis. I need to check both possibilities for the last digit (0 and 5) and see which gives me the larger number.\n\nIf I use 0 as the last digit:\n- Remaining digits: [6, 9, 5]\n- Arrange in descending order: 965\n- Complete number: 9650\n\nIf I use 5 as the last digit:\n- Remaining digits: [6, 0, 9]\n- Arrange in descending order: 960\n- Complete number: 9605\n\nComparing 9650 and 9605, clearly 9650 is larger.\n\nHowever, I should verify that 9650 is actually divisible by 5, and also check if it's within the oracle_max limit of 9650.\n\nLet me use the tools to confirm this result.\nACTION",
