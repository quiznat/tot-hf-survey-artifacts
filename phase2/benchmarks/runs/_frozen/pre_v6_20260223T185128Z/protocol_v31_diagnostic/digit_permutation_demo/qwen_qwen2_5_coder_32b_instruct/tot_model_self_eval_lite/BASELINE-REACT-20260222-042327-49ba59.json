The oracle_max of 5421 gives me an upper bound, but I should first check if there's a larger valid number.\n\nLet me think about this systematically:\n1. First, I'll check what numbers can be made with these digits and see which ones are divisible by 3\n2. Since we want the largest possible number, I should try to arrange the digits in descending order\n3. However, I also need to ensure the resulting number is divisible by 3\n\nLet me start by checking if any arrangement works, and use the tools available to verify divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [1, 2, 5, 4], \"divisor\": 3}",
