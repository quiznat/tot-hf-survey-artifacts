    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 2, 5] that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max of 9625 suggests an upper bound, but I should look for the maximum possible number first.\n\nTo maximize the number, I should arrange the digits in descending order: 9652. However, I need to check if this is divisible by 11.\n\nLet me use the divisibility rule for 11: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of digits in odd positions and the sum of digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including 0).\n\nFor 9652:\n- Odd positions (1st, 3rd): 9 + 5 = 14\n- Even positions (2nd, 4th): 6 + 2",

Since I want the largest number, I should try arrangements close to 9652 and work my way down systematically.\n\nLet me try the tool \"best_divisible\" to find the best divisible number directly.\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [6, 9, 2, 5], \"",
