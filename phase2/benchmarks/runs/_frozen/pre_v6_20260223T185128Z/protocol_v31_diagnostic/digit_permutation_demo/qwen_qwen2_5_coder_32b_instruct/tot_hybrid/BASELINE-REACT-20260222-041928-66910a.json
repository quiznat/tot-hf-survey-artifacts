    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 0, 3, 4] that is divisible by 5. The oracle_max constraint is 4300, so the answer must not exceed this value.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 5: it must end in 0 or 5. Looking at my available digits [0, 0, 3, 4], I can only use 0 to make a number divisible by 5 (since there's no 5 in the digits).\n\nSo I need to form the largest possible number \u2264 4300 using these digits that ends in 0.\n\nLet me think about how to arrange the digits [0, 0, 3, 4] to create the largest valid number:\n1. The number must end in 0 (to be divisible by 5)\n2",

Since I don't have a 5 in my digits [0, 0, 3, 4], the number must end in 0.\n\nTo maximize the number while keeping it \u2264 4300, I should:\n1. Place the largest available digits in the highest place values\n2. Ensure the number ends in 0\n3. Make sure the result doesn't exceed 4300\n\nThe available digits are [0, 0, 3, 4].

I have digits [0, 0, 3, 4] and need the largest number \u2264 4300 that's divisible by 5.\n\nSince the number must be divisible by 5 and I only have 0 as a valid ending digit, the number must end in 0.\n\nTo maximize the number under 4300:\n- Thousands place: Can use 4 (since 4000 < 4300) \n- Hundreds place: Can use 3\n- Tens place: Must use 0\n- Units place: Must use 0\n\nThis gives us 4300, but I need to check if 4300 is actually divisible by 5.\n4300 \u00f7 5 = 860, which is an integer, so yes, 4300 is divisible by 5",
