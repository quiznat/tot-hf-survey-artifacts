    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider (6312). \n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n1. I need to create the largest possible number from the given digits\n2. Check if it's divisible by 4\n3. If not, try rearranging the digits to make it divisible by 4\n4. Consider the oracle_max constraint\n\nSince I want the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order first, then check divisibility by 4.\n\nThe largest arrangement would be 6321.
