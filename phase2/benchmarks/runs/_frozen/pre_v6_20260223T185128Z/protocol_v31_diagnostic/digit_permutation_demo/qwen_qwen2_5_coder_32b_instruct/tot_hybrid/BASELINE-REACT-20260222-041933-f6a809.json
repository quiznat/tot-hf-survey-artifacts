Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 6:\n- A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it's divisible by both 2 and 3\n- For divisibility by 2: the last digit must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)\n- For divisibility by 3: the sum of all digits must be divisible by 3\n\nLet me check the sum of the given digits: 3 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 9\nSince 9 is divisible by 3, any arrangement of these digits will satisfy the divisibility by 3 condition.\n\nFor divisibility by 2, I need the last",

For divisibility by 6: the number must be divisible by both 2 and 3\n2. For divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3\n3. For divisibility by 2: last digit must be even\n\nSum of digits: 3 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 9, which is divisible by 3, so any arrangement satisfies the divisibility by 3 condition.\n\nFor divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even.
