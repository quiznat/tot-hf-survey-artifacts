The oracle_max of 2443 suggests an upper bound, but I should check if there's a larger valid number.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits and check which ones are divisible by 7.\n\nThe available digits are: 3, 2, 4, 4\n\nI can form various 4-digit numbers using these digits. To maximize the number, I should try to arrange them in descending order first (4, 4, 3, 2) to get 4432, but I need to check if this is divisible by 7.\n\nLet me use the tools systematically to find the best divisible number.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 2, 4,",
