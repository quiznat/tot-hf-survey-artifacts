Since the oracle_max is 8589, I need to ensure my answer doesn't exceed this value.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits and check which ones are divisible by 7.\n\nThe available digits are: 5, 8, 8, 9\n\nI should try to form the largest possible numbers first and check divisibility.\n\nLet me start by trying to form the largest 4-digit number: 9885\nThen check if it's divisible by 7.\n\nIf not, I'll try other arrangements in descending order.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 9885 7",
