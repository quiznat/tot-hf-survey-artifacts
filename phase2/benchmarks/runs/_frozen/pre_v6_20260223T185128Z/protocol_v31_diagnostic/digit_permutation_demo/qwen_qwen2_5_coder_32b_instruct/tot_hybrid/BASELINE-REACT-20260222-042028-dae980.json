    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [2, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 5.

First, I'll check what numbers can be formed with these digits\n2. Then I'll check which ones are divisible by 5\n3. Finally, I'll pick the largest one\n\nSince a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is 0 or 5, and I have two 5s available, I should place one 5 at the end to make it divisible by 5.\n\nTo get the largest number, I should arrange the remaining digits (2, 5, 6) in descending order first, then put",

Since I don't have a 0, I must end with 5.\n\nTo maximize the number, I want the largest digits in the leftmost positions.
