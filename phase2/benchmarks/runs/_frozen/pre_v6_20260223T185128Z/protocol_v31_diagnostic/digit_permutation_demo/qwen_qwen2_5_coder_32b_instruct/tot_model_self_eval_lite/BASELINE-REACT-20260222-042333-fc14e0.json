The oracle_max is 9840, so the answer must be less than or equal to 9840.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me try to construct the largest possible number using these digits that is <= 9840 and divisible by 8.\n\nThe available digits are: 0, 4, 9, 8\n\nTo get the largest number \u2264 9840, I should try to make numbers starting with 9, then 8, etc., but also ensure divisibility by 8.\n\nLet me check if I can make 9840 itself - it",
