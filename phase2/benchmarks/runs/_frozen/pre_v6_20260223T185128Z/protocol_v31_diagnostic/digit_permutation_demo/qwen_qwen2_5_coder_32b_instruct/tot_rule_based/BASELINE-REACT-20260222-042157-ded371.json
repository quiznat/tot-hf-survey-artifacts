    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 4312.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with digits [4, 1, 2, 3]. Since I have 4 digits, I can form 4! = 24 different 4-digit numbers.\n\nTo be divisible by 8, a number must be divisible by 8. A quick way to check divisibility by 8 is to see if the last three digits of the number form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me think about this systematically:\n1. I want the largest possible number \u2264 4312\n2. It must be divisible by 8\n3. It must use exactly the digits 4, 1",

I need to find the largest 4-digit number using digits [4, 1, 2, 3] that is divisible by 8 and \u2264 4312.\n\nSince I want the largest number \u2264 4312, I should start by trying to form numbers in descending order of magnitude, but I also need to ensure divisibility by 8.\n\nThe key insight is that for divisibility by 8, I only need to check if the last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me try to construct the largest valid number:\n- The maximum possible number would be 4321, but I need to check if it's divisible by 8\n- If not, I'll try other arrangements\n\nActually, let me use the available tools more effectively. I'll first check what numbers are divisible by 8 among those I can make, then pick",
