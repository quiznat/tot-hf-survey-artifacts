If not, I'll need to rearrange the digits to find a number that is divisible by 8.\n\nLet me start by trying to form the largest number possible with these digits, which would be 4211, and then check if it's divisible by 8.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4211 8\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I should use the best_divisible tool first to get the maximum number that is divisible by 8 from the given digits.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [1, 2, 4, 1] 8\n\nActually, let me think more systematically.
