    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 4, 2, 1] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max of 4102 suggests this is an upper bound for consideration.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 0, 4, 2, 1. I can arrange them in different orders to create various numbers.\n\nSince I want the largest possible number that's divisible by 7, I should try to form the largest possible numbers first and check if they're divisible by 7.\n\nThe largest arrangement would be 4210, but I should also consider other arrangements like 4201, 4120, etc.\n\nLet me start by trying the largest possible number and work my way down, checking divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [",
