    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 3, 1, 5] that is divisible by 5. Since we want the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order, but I also need to ensure the number ends in 0 or 5 to be divisible by 5. Looking at the available digits [8, 3, 1, 5], I see that 5 is already present, so any arrangement ending in 5 will be divisible by 5. To get the largest number, I should place the largest digits first, which means arranging them as 8531. However, I should verify this is indeed divisible by 5 and check if there's a larger valid arrangement.\n\nLet me use the best_divisible tool to find the best arrangement.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [8, 3, 1,",
