The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider (6312). \n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n1. I need to create the largest possible number from the given digits\n2. That number must be divisible by 4\n3. That number must not exceed 6312\n\nI'll start by trying to form the largest numbers and check divisibility, or use the available tools to help me systematically find this number.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 1, 6, 2], \"divisor\": 4,",
