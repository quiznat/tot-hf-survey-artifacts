I need to compare two possibilities:\n\n1) Using 0 as the last digit: Remaining digits [6, 9, 5] arranged in descending order = 965, so the number is 9650\n2) Using 5 as the last digit: Remaining digits [6, 0, 9] arranged in descending order = 960, so the number is 9605\n\nComparing these two options: 9650 vs 9605, clearly 9650 is larger.\n\nHowever, I should verify that 9650 is indeed divisible by 5 and check if it's within the oracle_max limit of 9650.\n\nLet me use the is_divisible tool to confirm 9650 is divisible by 5.\nACTION: is_divisible 9",

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I made an error in my tool call. I need to provide the complete number to the is_divisible tool. Let me correct this and also verify that 9650 is indeed divisible by 5 and within the limit.\n\nThe number 9650 should be checked for divisibility by 5. Since it ends in 0, it is definitely divisible by 5. But I should still use the tool to confirm.\n\nAlso, I need to double-check that 9650 doesn't exceed the oracle_max of 9650. Since 9650 equals 9650, it's acceptable.\n\nLet me try again with the full number.\nACTION: is_divisible 9650 5\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: yes\nSTEP 4 MODEL: FINAL: 9650"
