    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 2] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max of 9420 suggests an upper bound, but I should first understand what makes a number divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 if and only if it's divisible by both 2 and 3:\n- Divisibility by 2: The last digit must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)\n- Divisibility by 3: The sum of all digits must be divisible by 3\n\nLet me check the sum of available digits: 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, any arrangement of these digits will satisfy the divisibility by 3 condition.\n\nFor divisibility by 2",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 2] that is divisible by 6. \n\nFrom my analysis:\n- The sum of digits 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so any arrangement satisfies divisibility by 3\n- For divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)\n- Available even digits from [9, 4, 0, 2] are: 4, 0, 2\n\nTo maximize the number, I want the largest possible digits in the highest place values. The largest digit is 9, so it should be in the thousands place.\n\nSince I want the largest number, I'll arrange the remaining digits (4, 0, 2)",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: To form the largest number divisible by 6 using digits [9, 4, 0, 2]:\n1. The sum of digits is 15, which is divisible by 3, so any arrangement satisfies divisibility by 3\n2. For divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even (0, 2, 4)\n3. To maximize the number, I want the largest digits in the highest place values\n4. The largest digit is 9, so it should be in the thousands place\n5. For the last digit, I want the largest even digit available: 4\n6. This leaves digits 0 and 2 for the hundreds and tens places\n7. To maximize, I put 2 in the hundreds place and 0 in the tens place\n8. So far I have: 920_ where _ is the last digit (4)\n9",
    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I need to verify my reasoning by checking if 9204 is divisible by 6. I already know it's divisible by 3 since 9+2+0+4=15, which is divisible by 3. For divisibility by 2, the last digit is 4, which is even. So 9204 should be divisible by 6. However, I should also check if there's a larger valid number by trying other arrangements with different last digits.\n\nLet me try arranging the digits to see if I can get a larger number while still satisfying the divisibility conditions.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [9, 4, 0, 2], \"divisor\": 6}",

    "STEP 5 MODEL: THINK: I've used the best_divisible tool and got 9420 as the result. Let me verify this is correct by checking if 9420 is indeed divisible by 6 and uses the given digits.\n\nThe digits used are 9, 4, 2, 0 - which matches our available digits [9, 4, 0, 2].\nSum of digits: 9 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 15, which is divisible by 3.\nLast digit is 0, which is even, so it's divisible by 2.\nSince it's divisible by both 2 and 3, it's divisible by 6.\n\nThe oracle_max is 9420, and our answer 9420 equals this maximum, which confirms it's the largest possible valid number.\n\nFINAL: 9420"
