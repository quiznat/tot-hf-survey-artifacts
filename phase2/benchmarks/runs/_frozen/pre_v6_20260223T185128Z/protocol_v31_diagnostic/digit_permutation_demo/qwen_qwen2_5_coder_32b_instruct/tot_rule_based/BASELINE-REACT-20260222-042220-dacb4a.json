I should first try to form the largest possible number and check if it's divisible by 7, then work my way down if needed.\n\nLet me start by trying to form the largest number possible with these digits: 8854. Then I'll check if this is divisible by 7.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 8854 7\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The oracle_max is 5488, so I need to find the largest number \u2264 5488 that uses these digits and is divisible by 7.\n\nActually, let me approach this systematically.
