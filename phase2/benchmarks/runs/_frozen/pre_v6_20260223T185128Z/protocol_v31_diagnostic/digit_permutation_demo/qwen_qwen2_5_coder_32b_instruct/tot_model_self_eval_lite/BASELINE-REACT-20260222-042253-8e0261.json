    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max of 9636 suggests this should be a 4-digit number.\n\nTo solve this, I should:\n1. First check if there's a way to arrange these digits to form a number divisible by 4\n2. Since we want the maximum number, I should try to arrange the digits in descending order first\n3. Use the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4\n\nLet me start by trying different arrangements and checking divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [9, 3, 6, 6], \"divisor\": 4}",
