    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 8, 1, 6] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 5816. \n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n1. I need to create the largest possible number from the digits [5, 8, 1, 6]\n2. Check if it's divisible by 8\n3. If not, try different arrangements\n4. But I also need to respect the oracle_max constraint (5816)\n\nThe largest arrangement would be 8651, but I need to check if this is within bounds and divisible by 8.\n\nActually, let me reconsider",

But I need to check if this is within the oracle_max limit (5816) and divisible by 8.\n\nSince 8651 > 5816, I need to try smaller arrangements.\n\nLet me try 6851 - this is still > 5816.\nLet me try 6581 - this is still > 5816.\nLet me try 5861",
