    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 8, 8, 9] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 8589.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 5, 8, 8, 9. I can arrange them in different orders to create different numbers.\n\nSince I want the largest possible number that's divisible by 7, I should try to form the largest possible arrangement first and work my way down until I find one divisible by 7.\n\nThe largest arrangement would be 9885. But I need to check if it's divisible by 7.\n\nLet me start by checking if 9885 is divisible by 7 using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 988",

The next largest arrangements would be 9858, 9588, etc. But since I'm looking for the largest number divisible by 7, I should systematically check from the largest possible number downwards.\n\nLet me try 9885 again properly, then move to the next largest arrangements if needed.\nACTION: is_divisible 9885\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: no\n\nTHINK: Since 9885 is not divisible by 7, I need to try the next largest arrangement.
