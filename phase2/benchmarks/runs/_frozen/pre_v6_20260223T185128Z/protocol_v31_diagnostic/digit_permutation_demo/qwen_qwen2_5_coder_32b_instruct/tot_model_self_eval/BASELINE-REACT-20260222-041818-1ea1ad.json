    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider (6312). \n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me identify all possible 4-digit combinations from the given digits [3, 1, 6, 2] and check which ones are divisible by 4, keeping in mind the oracle_max constraint.\n\nThe approach:\n1. Generate all permutations of the 4 digits\n2. Check which ones form numbers \u2264 6312\n3. Among those, check which are divisible by 4\n4. Return the maximum such number\n\nActually, let me use the available tools more systematically.",

I need to find the largest number \u2264 6312 that can be formed with digits [3, 1, 6, 2] and is divisible by 4.\n\nFirst, I'll generate all possible 4-digit arrangements of these digits, then filter for those \u2264 6312, then check divisibility by 4.\n\nHowever, I notice I have two tools: \"best_divisible\" and \"is_divisible\". Let me see if I can use them effectively.\n\nSince I want the largest number, I should try arrangements in descending order. But first, let me check if there's a smarter way using the tools.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - I should first check what numbers can be made with these digits, then apply the constraints.\n\nLet me start by generating some candidate numbers systematically.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 1",

The `best_divisible` tool seems most appropriate since I want the largest valid number.\n\nHowever, I notice my previous ACTION was cut off. Let me properly call the tool with correct parameters.\n\nTo use `best_divisible`, I need to provide:\n- digits: [3, 1, 6, 2]\n- divisor: 4  \n- max_value: 6312\n\nThis should give me the largest number meeting all criteria.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 1, 6, 2], \"divisor\": 4, \"max_value\": 6312",
