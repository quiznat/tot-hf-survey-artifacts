    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 8, 5] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max of 5803 suggests there's an upper limit, but I should first determine what the largest possible number is with these digits, then check divisibility.\n\nLet me think about this systematically:\n1. First, I should arrange the digits in descending order to get the largest possible number: 8530\n2. Then I need to check if this number is divisible by 7\n3. If not, I'll need to try other arrangements that are less than or equal to 8530 and check for divisibility\n\nActually, let me reconsider - I should use the available tools properly. I have \"best_divisible\" which likely finds the best (largest) number divisible by the divisor, and \"is_divisible\"",

Since I have access to tools, I should use them effectively.\n\nThe best approach would be to use the \"best_divisible\" tool which should help me find the largest number formed from the given digits that is divisible by 7. This tool is specifically designed for this purpose.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 0, 8, 5], \"divisor\": 7}",
