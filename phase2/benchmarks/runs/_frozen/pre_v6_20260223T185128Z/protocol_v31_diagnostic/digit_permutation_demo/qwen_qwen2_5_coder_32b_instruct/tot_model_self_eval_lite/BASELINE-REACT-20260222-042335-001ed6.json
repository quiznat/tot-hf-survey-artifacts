    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the given digits [2, 4, 8, 1] that is divisible by 8.

To make the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order: 8421\n2. However, I need to ensure this number is divisible by 8\n3. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8\n4.
