    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max is 9852, so I should look for numbers up to that value.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check all possible combinations of the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] to find which ones form numbers divisible by 4, and then find the maximum among them.\n\nThe approach:\n1. Generate all permutations of the digits [9, 8, 5, 2]\n2. Check which ones are divisible by 4 (using the last two digits rule)\n3. Find the maximum among valid numbers\n\nActually, let me use the available tools more strategically.",

I need to find the largest number using digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4, with a maximum constraint of 9852.\n\nSince I have the tools \"best_divisible\" and \"is_divisible\", I should use them strategically.\n\nFirst, I'll try to generate the largest possible number from the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] and check if it's divisible by 4. If not, I'll try other arrangements.\n\nThe largest arrangement would be 9852, but I need to verify if this is divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check if 9852 is divisible by 4 by looking at its last two digits: 52.\n52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so 52 is divisible by 4.\nTherefore, 98",
