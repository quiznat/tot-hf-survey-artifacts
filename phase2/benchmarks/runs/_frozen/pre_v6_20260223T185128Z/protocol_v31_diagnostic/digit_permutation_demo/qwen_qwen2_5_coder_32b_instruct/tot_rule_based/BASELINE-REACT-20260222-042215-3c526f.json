    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 2, 3, 1] that is divisible by 8. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that's divisible by 8.\n\nSince I want the largest possible number, I should arrange the digits in descending order as much as possible, but I need to ensure the last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me try different arrangements and check divisibility by 8.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [8, 2, 3, 1], \"divisor\": 8}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The tool returned 8312 as the best divisible number. Let me verify this is correct by checking if 8312 is divisible by 8 and if it uses all the given digits.\n\nTo check if 8312 is divisible by 8, I need to see if the last three digits (312) are divisible by 8.\n312 \u00f7 8 = 39\n\nSince 312 is divisible by 8, then 8312 is divisible by 8.\n\nNow let me verify it uses all the digits [8, 2, 3, 1]:\n- 8 appears once \u2713\n- 3 appears once \u2713  \n- 1 appears once \u2713\n- 2 appears once \u2713\n\nAll digits are used exactly once.\n\nFINAL: 8312"
