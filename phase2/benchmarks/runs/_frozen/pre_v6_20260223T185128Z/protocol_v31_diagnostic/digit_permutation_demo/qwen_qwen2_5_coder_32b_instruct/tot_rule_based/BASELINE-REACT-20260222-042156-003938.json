    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [2, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 5. Since the divisor is 5, I need to check which arrangements of these digits form numbers divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Looking at my available digits [2, 5, 6, 5], I have two 5s and one 2 and one 6. To make the largest possible number, I should arrange the digits in descending order, but ensure it ends in 5 (since 0 isn't available). The largest arrangement ending in 5 would be 6552. However, I should verify this systematically using the available tools.\n\nLet me first try to use the best_divisible tool to see what the maximum divisible number is, then verify with is_divisible",
