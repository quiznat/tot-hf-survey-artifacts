    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 4, 9, 3] that is divisible by 7. Since the oracle_max is 3934, I should look for numbers up to that limit.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 3, 4, 9, 3. I can arrange them in different orders to create different numbers.\n\nThe maximum possible number would be 9433 (using all digits in descending order). However, I need to check if this is divisible by 7 and if it's within the oracle_max limit.\n\nLet me start by checking if 9433 is divisible by 7. If not, I'll try other arrangements systematically or use the available tools.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 9433 7\n\nWait, I should reconsider",

I need to find the largest number that can be formed with digits [3, 4, 9, 3] that is divisible by 7 and does not exceed 3934.\n\nSince 9433 > 3934, I don't even need to check if it's divisible by 7. I need to consider smaller arrangements of these digits.\n\nLet me think about how to systematically approach this. I should generate numbers less than or equal to 3934 using the digits [3, 4, 9, 3] and check which ones are divisible by 7.\n\nThe largest possible 4-digit number using these digits is 9433, but since that exceeds 3934, I need to consider numbers starting with",
