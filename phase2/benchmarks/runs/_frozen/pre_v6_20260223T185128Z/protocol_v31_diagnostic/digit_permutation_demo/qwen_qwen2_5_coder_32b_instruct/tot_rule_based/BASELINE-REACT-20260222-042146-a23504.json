    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 6, 3, 4] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max of 6643 suggests this is a constraint on the maximum value I should consider.\n\nFirst, let me understand what I'm looking for:\n1. A number formed from digits [6, 6, 3, 4]\n2. That number must be divisible by 7\n3. That number should be as large as possible (but not exceed 6643)\n\nLet me try different arrangements of these digits and check which ones are divisible by 7, starting with the largest possible numbers.\n\nThe largest possible arrangement would be 6643, but I need to check if it's divisible by 7.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 6643 7\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I should first check",
