    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 3, 2, 1] that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max of 4312 suggests this is the maximum possible value, but I should verify if there's a larger arrangement that's divisible by 11.\n\nLet me first understand what numbers I can form with these digits and check which ones are divisible by 11.\n\nThe available digits are [4, 3, 2, 1]. I need to arrange them to create the largest possible number divisible by 11.\n\nI'll use the divisibility rule for 11: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of digits in odd positions and the sum of digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including 0).\n\nLet me try different arrangements systematically, starting with the largest possible number",

For a 4-digit number with digits A, B, C, D (from left to right), the number is divisible by 11 if (A + C) - (B + D) is divisible by 11.\n\nSince we want the largest number, I should try arrangements where the leftmost digits are as large as possible, while still satisfying the divisibility condition.\n\nLet me try some arrangements systematically, checking each one with the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 4231 11\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: no",
