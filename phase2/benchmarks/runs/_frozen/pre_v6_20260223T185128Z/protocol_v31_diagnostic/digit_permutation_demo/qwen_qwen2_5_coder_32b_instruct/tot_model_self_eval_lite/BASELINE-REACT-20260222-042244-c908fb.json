    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 8, 5] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max of 5803 suggests there's an upper limit, but I should first find the largest possible arrangement of these digits and then check divisibility.\n\nLet me think about this systematically:\n1. First, I'll arrange the digits in descending order to get the largest possible number: 8530\n2. Then I'll check if this number is divisible by 7\n3. If not, I'll try other arrangements until I find one that works or determine it's impossible\n\nActually, let me approach this more systematically using the available tools. I should use the best_divisible tool which likely helps find the best divisible number from given digits.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 0, 8, 5],",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: FINAL: 5802\n\nThe largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 8, 5] that is divisible by 7 is 5802. This was determined by checking arrangements of the digits and finding that 5802 is divisible by 7 (5802 \u00f7 7 = 828.857...), but actually let me reconsider this more carefully.\n\nLooking at my previous response, I made an error. Let me recheck systematically:\n\nThe digits are [3, 0, 8, 5]. To form the largest number, I'd arrange them as 8530. But I need the largest number \u2264 5803 that uses these digits and is divisible by 7.\n\nLet me check numbers systematically:\n- 8530 > 5803, so too large\n- Next largest"
