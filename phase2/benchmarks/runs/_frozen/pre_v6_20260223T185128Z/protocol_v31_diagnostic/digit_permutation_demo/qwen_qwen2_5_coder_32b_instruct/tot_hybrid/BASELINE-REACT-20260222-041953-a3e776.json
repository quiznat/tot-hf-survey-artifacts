    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check all possible combinations of the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] to find which arrangements give numbers divisible by 4, and then pick the largest one.\n\nActually, let me use the available tools more systematically. I'll first try to find the best arrangement using the best_divisible tool, or check divisibility with is_divisible tool on different arrangements.\n\nSince I want the maximum number, I should try to arrange the digits in descending order first, but also ensure it's divisible by 4.\n\nThe largest possible",

First, I need to understand when a number is divisible by 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4\n2. I want the largest possible number, so I should try to arrange the digits in descending order as much as possible\n3. However, I must ensure the resulting number is divisible by 4\n\nLet me start by checking what pairs of digits from [9, 3, 6, 6] can form numbers divisible by 4:\n- 96: 96 \u00f7 4 = 24 \u2713\n- 66: 66 \u00f7 4 = 16.5 \u2717\n- 69",
