    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [2, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 5. Since we want the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order, but I also need to ensure the result is divisible by 5.\n\nLet me think about this step by step:\n1. First, I'll check what numbers can be made with these digits\n2. Then I'll check which ones are divisible by 5\n3. Finally, I'll pick the largest one\n\nSince any number divisible by 5 must end in 0 or 5, and I have two 5s available, I should try to make the largest possible number ending in 5.\n\nThe digits are [2, 5, 6, 5].
