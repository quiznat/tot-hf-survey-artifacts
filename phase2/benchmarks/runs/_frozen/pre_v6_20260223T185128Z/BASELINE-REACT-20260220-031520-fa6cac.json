    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given the numbers [4, 4, 10, 10] and need to combine them (using arithmetic operations) to reach 24, a classic \"24 game\" puzzle.

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's try more systematic approaches. Since 10 and 4 are both even, maybe division or multiplication can help. Consider (10 - 4/4) \u00d7 something? 4/4 = 1, so 10 - 1 = 9. Then 9 \u00d7 ? = 24? 24/9 = 8/3 \u2014 not helpful.\n\nWhat about (10 \u00d7 10 - 4) / 4 = (100 - 4)/4 = 96/4 = 24! Yes! That uses both 10s, one 4 in subtraction, and the other 4 as divisor \u2014 all four numbers exactly once.\n\nSo expression: (10 \u00d7 10 - 4) \u00f7 4 = 24.\n\nLet\u2019s verify with calc tool.\nACTION: calc (10 * 10 -",
