    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop with input [2, 5, 6, 6] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve computing an aggregate (e.g., sum, product, average), or checking properties (e.g., if they can form a valid expression to reach 24). Given the numbers [2, 5, 6, 6], a classic \"24 game\" is plausible. Let me try to compute the sum first as a baseline.\n\nSum = 2 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 19  \nBut 19 is not particularly special. Alternatively, maybe the task is to compute the product: 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 360. Or perhaps find the average: 19 /",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [2, 5, 6, 6], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since the task is unspecified, but given the numbers and common benchmark patterns (e.g., 24 game), I should try to see if these numbers can be combined using arithmetic operations to reach 24. Let me test some combinations manually first. For example:  \n- (6 + 6) \u00d7 (5 - 2) = 12 \u00d7 3 = 36 \u2192 too high  \n- 6 \u00d7 5 - 6 \u00f7 2 = 30 - 3 = 27  \n- 6 \u00d7 2 + 6 + 5 = 12 + 6 + 5 = 23  \n- (6 \u00d7 6) - (5 + 2) = 36 - 7 = 29  \n- (6",

Since the task is unspecified but benchmark tasks with such inputs often involve the 24 Game (i.e., using all numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7 and parentheses to make 24), I should try to find such an expression. Let me test promising combinations using `calc` to verify. Try: (6 + 6) \u00d7 2 = 24, but that uses only two numbers (6,6,2) and leaves out 5. Need to use all four numbers. Try: 6 \u00d7 5 \u2212 6 \u00f7 2 = 30 \u2212 3 = 27 \u2014 too high. Try: (6 \u00d7 2) + (6 + 5) = 12 + 11 = 23 \u2014 close",
