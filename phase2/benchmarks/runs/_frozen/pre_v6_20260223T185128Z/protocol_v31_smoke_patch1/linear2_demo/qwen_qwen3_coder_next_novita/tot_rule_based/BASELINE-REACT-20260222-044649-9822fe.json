    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides a system of two linear equations in two variables, represented as coefficients and constants. The equations are:\n1. 4x + 9y = -9\n2. 9x - y = 86\n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system given the coefficient matrix and constants. The input format for `solve2` is probably the augmented matrix or separate coefficient and constant arrays. Given the input structure `[[4, 9, -9], [9, -1, 86]]`, each row is [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So `solve2` should accept this directly.\n\nLet me use `solve2` with the given equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[4, 9, -9], [9, -1, 8",
