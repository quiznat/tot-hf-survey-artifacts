    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 4x + 9y = -9  \nEquation 2: 9x - y = 86  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since there are two equations and two unknowns, we can use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which is likely designed to solve a system of two linear equations. If `solve2` expects input in a specific format (e.g., coefficients and constants), we can pass the equations directly.\n\nAlternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution, but we don\u2019t yet have a candidate. So first, try `solve2`.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[4, 9,",
