    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9852. I need to verify or find the correct largest divisible number using the tools. First, I should check if 9852 is divisible by 4 using the `is_divisible` tool. If not, I'll need to try the next largest permutation using `best_divisible`, which likely returns the largest number \u2264 given max that is divisible by the divisor.\n\nBut first, let's recall: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9852, last two digits are 52 \u2192 52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so 52 is divisible by 4 \u2192 98",

Since 9852 ends in 52, and 52 \u00f7 4 = 13 (integer), 9852 is divisible by 4. So 9852 itself satisfies the condition. Since it's also the oracle_max (i.e., the largest possible permutation), it must be the answer. I should verify using `is_divisible` to be safe, but reasoning confirms it. Let\u2019s confirm with the tool to be rigorous.",

Since 9852 is the largest possible permutation of those digits, and the last two digits are 52, and 52 \u00f7 4 = 13 (an integer), 9852 is divisible by 4.
