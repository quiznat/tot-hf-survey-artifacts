    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 8, 4, 6] that is divisible by 3, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 8664. Let's verify if 8664 is divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Sum of digits of 8664: 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 24, and 24 is divisible by 3 (24 \u00f7 3 = 8). So 8664 is divisible by 3. Also, using the digits [6, 8, 4, 6], the largest possible arrangement is 8664 (since digits sorted descending: 8, 6, 6, 4 \u2192 866",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 8664, and we verified that 8664 is divisible by 3 (digit sum = 24, divisible by 3), and it uses the digits [6, 8, 4, 6] exactly (two 6s, one 8, one 4). Since 8664 is the largest permutation of those digits (8664), and it's divisible by 3, it must be the answer. We can confirm using the is_divisible tool to be thorough, but it's already clear. Let's double-check with the tool to be safe.\nACTION: is_divisible 8664 3",
