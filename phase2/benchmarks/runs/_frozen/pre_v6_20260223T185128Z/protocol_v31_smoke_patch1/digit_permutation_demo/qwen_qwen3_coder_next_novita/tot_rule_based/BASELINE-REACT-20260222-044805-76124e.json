    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 2, 3, 2] that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum is 5322. Let's verify if 5322 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. For divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2014 5322 ends in 2, so OK. For divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3 \u2014 5+3+2+2 = 12, which is divisible by 3. So 5322 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 5322. But to be thorough, maybe",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle claims the maximum valid number is 5322. We verified that 5322 is divisible by 6 (ends in 2 \u2192 divisible by 2; digit sum 12 \u2192 divisible by 3). Since the task is to find the largest such number, and the oracle provides an upper bound, we should confirm that 5322 is indeed achievable with the given digits [5,2,3,2] \u2014 and it is (digits match exactly). No larger permutation exists with these digits (next possible would be 5322 \u2192 5322 is the largest arrangement in descending order: 5,3,2,2). Therefore, 5322 is the correct answer. We can use `is_divisible` to double-check, but reasoning suffices. However, to strictly follow ReAct, we should verify with the tool.\nACTION: is",
