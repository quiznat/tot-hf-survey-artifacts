    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number \u2264 3934 that can be formed using the digits [3, 4, 9, 3] (each used exactly once) and is divisible by 7. We have two tools: `is_divisible(n, d)` to check if n is divisible by d, and `best_divisible(digits, divisor, max_val)` which likely returns the largest number \u2264 max_val formed from digits divisible by divisor. Since `best_divisible` is directly available and matches the task, we should use it.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [3, 4, 9, 3] 7 3934",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 3934",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The tool `best_divisible` returned 3934 directly. Now I need to verify if 3934 is indeed formed using the digits [3, 4, 9, 3] exactly once each, and is divisible by 7. Let's check:  \n- Digits of 3934 are [3, 9, 3, 4] \u2014 which matches the multiset [3, 4, 9, 3] (two 3s, one 4, one 9).  \n- Check divisibility by 7: 3934 \u00f7 7 = 562 exactly? 7 \u00d7 562 = 3934 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 3934 is valid. Since `best_divisible` returned it, and it satisfies all constraints, this is the answer.\n\nFINAL: 3"
