    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [7, 1, 6, 5] and is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 7651, which suggests that the maximum possible number from the digits is 7651 (since digits sorted descending: 7,6,5,1 \u2192 7651). We need to find the largest permutation \u2264 7651 that is divisible by 7.\n\nWe have two tools:\n- `is_divisible(n, d)`: checks if n is divisible by d.\n- `best_divisible(digits, divisor)`: likely returns the largest number formed by permuting digits divisible by divisor.\n\nBut since we\u2019re in a ReAct loop and need to act step-by-step, let\u2019s consider using `best_divisible` directly if it\u2019s designed for this purpose \u2014",

The oracle_max = 7651 is the maximum permutation (7,6,5,1 sorted descending). Since we have a tool `best_divisible(digits, divisor)`, and it's designed exactly for this purpose (finding the largest divisible number from given digits), we should use it directly rather than iterating manually. This avoids unnecessary steps and leverages the tool as intended.\nACTION: best_divisible [7, 1, 6, 5] 7",
