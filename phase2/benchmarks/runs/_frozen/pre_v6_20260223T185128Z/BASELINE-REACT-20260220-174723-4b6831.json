    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [4, 5, 5, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer what the goal might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing sum, product, average, or checking for some property (e.g., can we make 24 using arithmetic operations?). Given the numbers [4, 5, 5, 7], a classic 24 game variant is plausible.\n\nLet me try to see if these numbers can be combined to make 24. Try:  \n(7 - 5) \u00d7 (5 + 7) = 2 \u00d7 12 = 24 \u2014 but we only have one 7.  \n(5 \u00d7 5) - (7 - 4) = 25 - 3 = 22  \n(7",

Since the task is a benchmark and the numbers resemble those in the \"24 game\", a common goal is to use all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. Let me test possible combinations using `calc`. Try (7 - 5) * (5 + 7) \u2014 but that uses two 7s. Instead, try (5 * 5) - (7 - 4) = 25 - 3 = 22 (too low). Try (7 + 5) * (5 - 4) = 12 * 1 = 12.
