    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is a list of numbers: [4, 6, 7, 7]. The only available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., \"make 24\"), I need to infer the task. Common benchmark tasks with 4 numbers involve the 24 Game: using each number exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24.\n\nLet me try to find an expression using 4, 6, 7, 7 that equals 24.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 7 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 24 \u2192 7+7=14, 14+6=20, 20+4=24. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the expression is:",
