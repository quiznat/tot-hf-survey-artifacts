    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [2, 5, 5, 7], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with a list of numbers involve computing a result like sum, product, or perhaps forming an expression to reach a target (e.g., 24 game). Given the numbers [2, 5, 5, 7], a classic target is 24. Let me check if 24 is achievable:  \n- 5 \u00d7 5 = 25  \n- 25 \u2212 2 = 23  \n- 23 + 7 = 30 \u2192 too high  \n- (7 \u2212 5) = 2; 2 \u00d7 5 = 10; 10 + 5 = 1",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [2, 5, 5, 7], and the only tool is `calc`.

Let me test plausible combinations:  \n- (7 \u2212 5) = 2; 2 \u00d7 5 = 10; 10 + 2 = 12 \u2192 no  \n- 5 \u00d7 5 = 25; 25 \u2212 (7 \u2212 2) = 25 \u2212 5 = 20 \u2192 no  \n- (5 + 5) = 10; 10 + 7 = 17; 17 + 2 = 19  \n- Try multiplication",
