    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [1, 1, 2, 10]. I need to determine what operation to perform using the available tool `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, a common benchmark task with such inputs is to compute the result of combining them with arithmetic operations \u2014 perhaps to reach a target (like 24), or compute sum, product, etc. But since the task description is minimal, and the only tool is `calc`, I should try to compute something meaningful. A typical interpretation is to compute the sum: 1 + 1 + 2 + 10 = 14. Alternatively, maybe it's a puzzle like \"make 24\", but 1,1,2,10 can't easily make 24.
