    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [3, 8, 10, 10], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., compute a sum, find a pattern, etc.), I need to infer the likely objective. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve computing the sum, product, or applying arithmetic operations to reach a target (like 24 game). Given the numbers [3, 8, 10, 10], let\u2019s consider if they can form a known expression \u2014 for example, 24 game: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24, but we have two 10s left. Alternatively, maybe compute the sum: 3 + 8 + 10 + 10 = 31. Or perhaps the task is to compute the average: 3",
