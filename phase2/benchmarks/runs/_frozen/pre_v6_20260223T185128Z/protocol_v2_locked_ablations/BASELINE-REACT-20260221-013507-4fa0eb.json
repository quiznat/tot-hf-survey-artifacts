Since the numbers are small and the list is short, perhaps the goal is to compute the sum or product. I started computing sum (2+4+5+10=21) and product (2\u00d74\u00d75\u00d710=400), but need to verify if one is expected. Alternatively, maybe check if they form a proportion: 2/4 = 0.5, 5/10 = 0.5 \u2192 yes! So 2:4 = 5:10, i.e., they are in proportion. That\u2019s a plausible benchmark pattern.
