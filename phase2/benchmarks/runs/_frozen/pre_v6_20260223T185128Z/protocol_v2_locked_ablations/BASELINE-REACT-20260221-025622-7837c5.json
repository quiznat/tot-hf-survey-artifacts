    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [1, 6, 7, 9] and available tool `calc`. However, the task description is ambiguous \u2014 it doesn\u2019t specify *what* to compute with the numbers [1, 6, 7, 9]. In many benchmark tasks (e.g., 24 Game), the goal is to use all numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7) and parentheses to reach a target, often 24.\n\nLet\u2019s assume this is the 24 Game: use 1, 6, 7, 9 to make 24.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 9 + 7 + 6 + 1 = 23 \u2192 too low\n- 9 \u00d7 (7 \u2212 6) + 1 = 10 \u2192 too low\n- (9 \u2212",
