    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop with input [3, 3, 6, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to combine the numbers [3, 3, 6, 7] using arithmetic operations to reach a target (e.g., 24 game). However, no target is given. Alternatively, maybe the task is to compute something like sum, product, or find an expression. Since no target is specified, perhaps the goal is to compute the sum or some standard operation.\n\nLet\u2019s try computing the sum: 3 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 19. But maybe it's the 24 game: can we make 24 using 3, 3, 6, 7? Let's test possibilities:\n- 6 \u00d7 3 +",
