    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [2, 5, 5, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer what the goal might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing a sum, product, or checking for some property (e.g., can we make 24 using arithmetic operations?). Given the numbers [2, 5, 5, 7], a classic 24 game variant is plausible.\n\nLet me try to see if we can make 24 using these numbers with basic operations. Try:  \n(7 - 5) \u00d7 (5 + 2) = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14 \u2192 no  \n(5 \u00d7 5) - (7 - 2) = 25 - 5 = 20 \u2192 no  \n(7 + 5) \u00d7",
