    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [4, 4, 4, 9], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle: using the numbers 4, 4, 4, and 9 with arithmetic operations to reach 24. Let me try to find such an expression.\n\nPossible approaches:\n- 9 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21 \u2192 too low\n- 9 \u00d7 4 - 4 - 4 = 36 - 8 = 28 \u2192 too high\n- 9 \u00d7 (4 - 4/4) = 9 \u00d7 (4 - 1) = 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 too high\n- (9 - 4/4) \u00d7 4 = (9 - 1) \u00d7",

Try (4 + 4) \u00d7 (9 - 4) = 8 \u00d7 5 = 40 \u2014 too high. What about 9 \u00d7 4 - 4 - 4 = 28, still too high. Try division: 9 \u00d7 (4 + 4/4) = 9 \u00d7 (4 + 1) = 9 \u00d7 5 = 45 \u2014 too high. How about (4 \u00d7 4) + (9 - 4) = 16 + 5 = 21. Hmm. Try (9 + 4 + 4) + 4 = 21 again. Maybe use subtraction and multiplication: (",

What about (9 - 4) \u00d7 4 + 4 = 5 \u00d7 4 + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24! Yes! That uses all four numbers: 9, 4, 4, 4. Let me verify: (9 - 4) \u00d7 4 + 4 = 5 \u00d7 4 + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24. Perfect.
