Let\u2019s consider possible interpretations.\n\nCommon benchmark tasks with four numbers include forming a target (e.g., 24) using +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7 and parentheses.

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [1, 1, 5, 5], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no explicit target or operation is given, and this resembles classic \"make 24\" puzzles, I should try to compute a meaningful expression using all four numbers exactly once. Let\u2019s test combinations:\n\n- (5 + 1) \u00d7 (5 \u2212 1) = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 \u2192 uses both 5s and both 1s. Yes!  \nSo the expression is (5 + 1) * (5 - 1) = 24.\n\nI can verify this with `calc`.\nACTION: calc (5 + 1) * (5 - 1)",
