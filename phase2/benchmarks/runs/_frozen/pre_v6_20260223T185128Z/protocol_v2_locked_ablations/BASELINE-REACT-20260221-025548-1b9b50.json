    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [5, 6, 6, 10], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., compute a sum, find a pattern, etc.), I need to infer the likely intent. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing the sum, product, average, or checking for some property (e.g., can we make 24?).
