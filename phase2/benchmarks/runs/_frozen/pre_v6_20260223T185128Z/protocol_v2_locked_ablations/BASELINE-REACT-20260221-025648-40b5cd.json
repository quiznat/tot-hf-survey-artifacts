    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [2, 7, 8, 9], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, I need to infer what the benchmark task might be. Common tasks with a list of numbers include computing sum, product, average, or checking for some property (e.g., is there a pair that sums to something). Given the numbers 2, 7, 8, 9, a plausible task is to compute the sum: 2 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 26. Alternatively, maybe it's to find the maximum, minimum, or sort them. But without more context, the most straightforward use of `calc` is to compute a basic arithmetic operation. Let me try computing the sum using `calc`.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 7 + 8 + 9",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The calculation of the sum (2 + 7 + 8 + 9) yielded 26. Since the task input is just a list of numbers and no specific operation was provided, and given that `calc` is available, computing the sum is a reasonable and straightforward interpretation. The result 26 is correct and complete. No further steps are needed.\n\nFINAL: 26"
