    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [3, 3, 4, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to combine the numbers [3, 3, 4, 7] using arithmetic operations to reach a target (e.g., 24 game).
