Common tasks with number lists include computing the sum, average, or checking for patterns. Notably, 3, 6, 6, 9 could be part of an arithmetic sequence (difference of 3), but 6 repeats, so it's not strictly arithmetic. Alternatively, maybe the task is to compute the sum: 3 + 6 + 6 + 9 = 24. Let me verify using `calc`.\nACTION: calc 3 + 6 + 6 + 9",
