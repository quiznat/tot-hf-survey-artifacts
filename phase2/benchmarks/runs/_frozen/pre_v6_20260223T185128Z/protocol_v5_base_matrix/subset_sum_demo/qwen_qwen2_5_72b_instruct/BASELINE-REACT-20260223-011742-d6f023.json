    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find if there are any two numbers in the list that add up to the target number (51). Given that no external tools are available, I will proceed with a simple algorithm to check all possible pairs.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: I will start by checking the first number in the list and see if adding it to any other number in the list equals the target. Then, I will move on to the next number and repeat the process until a pair is found or all possibilities are exhausted.\n\nTHINK: Let's begin with the first number, which is 4. I will now try to find another number in the list that, when added to 4, equals 51.\n\nTHINK: 4 + 47 = 51, but 47 is not in the list. Next, I will try the second number, which is 5.\n\nTHINK",

Next, I will try the third number, which is 11.\n\nTHINK: 11 + 40 = 51, but 40 is not in the list.
