    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to find if there are any two numbers in the given list that add up to the target number (28). Since no external tools are available, I will use a simple algorithm to check pairs of numbers from the list to see if their sum equals the target.\n\nACTION: None, as no tools are required for this step.\n\nTHINK: I will iterate through the list and for each number, I will check if there is another number in the list that, when added to it, equals the target. To avoid checking the same pair twice, I can start the second loop from the current index + 1.\n\nACTION: None, continuing with the reasoning.\n\nTHINK: Let's go through the list:\n- For 1, check 2, 3, 3, 4, 12, 20, 22 (none of these add up to 28",
