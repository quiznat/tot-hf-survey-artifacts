    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, we need to find if any two numbers in the given list add up to the target number. Since no external tools are available, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through the list and checks for pairs that meet the condition. We can start by iterating through each number and checking if the complement (target - current number) exists in the list.\n\nACTION: None, start with the first number in the list and find its complement.\nTHINK: The first number is 10, and its complement to reach 37 is 27. We need to check if 27 is in the remaining part of the list.\n\nTHINK: 27 is not in the list. Move to the next number, which is 13, and find its complement.\nTHINK: The complement of 13 to reach 37 is 24. We need to check if 2",
