    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding a combination of numbers from the list that add up to the target number, 62. Since there are no tools provided, I will attempt to solve this problem through logical reasoning and manual computation.\n\nACTION: None, but I will start by trying to find pairs or groups of numbers that sum up to 62.\n\nTHINK: Let's start with the largest numbers and see if we can get close to 62. Adding 24 and 22 gives us 46. We need 16 more to reach 62. Looking at the remaining numbers [2, 6, 14, 18], 14 and 2 would give us 16. So, 24 + 22 + 14 + 2 = 62.\n\nFINAL: [2, 14, 22, 24"
