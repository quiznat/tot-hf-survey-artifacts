    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find two numbers in the list that add up to the target number, which is 9 in this case. Since there are no tools available, I will use a simple algorithm to check each pair of numbers to see if they sum up to the target.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: I will start by checking pairs from the beginning of the list with the rest of the elements. The first number is 1. I will now check if any of the other numbers in the list, when added to 1, equal 9.\n\nTHINK: 1 + 3 = 4 (not 9), 1 + 5 = 6 (not 9), 1 + 8 = 9 (this is a match). I have found a pair that adds up to the target number.\n\nFINAL: [1, 8]"
