Since there are no external tools available, I will use a simple algorithm to check pairs of numbers from the list to see if they sum up to the target.\n\nACTION: None needed, proceeding with reasoning.\n\nTHINK: I will start by considering each number in the list and check if there is another number in the list that, when added to it, equals the target value. To optimize, I can stop checking for a particular number once I've found a pair that works or have checked all possible pairs involving that number.\n\nTHINK: Let's begin with the first number (9) and check if adding any subsequent number in the list results in 43.\n\nTHINK: 9 + 10 = 19 (not 43), 9 + 13 =",
