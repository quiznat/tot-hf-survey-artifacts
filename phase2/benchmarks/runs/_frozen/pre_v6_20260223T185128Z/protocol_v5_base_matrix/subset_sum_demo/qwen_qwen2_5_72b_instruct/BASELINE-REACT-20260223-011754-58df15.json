    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find if there are any two numbers in the list that add up to the target number (36).

I'll initialize one pointer at the beginning (left) and another at the end (right) of the list. I'll check the sum of the numbers at these pointers and adjust the pointers based on whether the sum is less than or greater than the target.\n\nACTION: Initialize left pointer at 0 and right pointer at 5\n\nTHINK: The sum of the numbers at the current pointers (4 + 24) is 28, which is less",
