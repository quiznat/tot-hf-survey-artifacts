Since no tools are available, I will use a backtracking approach to explore all possible subsets.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: I will start by trying the first number in the list and see if it can be part of the solution. If it can, I will move on to the next number and repeat the process. If it cannot, I will backtrack and try the next number.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Let's start with the first number, 1. If I include 1, the remaining target is 29. Now I will try to find a subset of the remaining numbers that sums up to 29.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Moving to the next number, 4.
