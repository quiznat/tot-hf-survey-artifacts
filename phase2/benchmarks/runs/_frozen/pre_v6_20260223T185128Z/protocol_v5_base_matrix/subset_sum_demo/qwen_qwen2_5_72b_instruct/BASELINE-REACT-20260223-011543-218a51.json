    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to find if there are two numbers in the list that add up to the target number (21). Since no tools are available, I will solve this problem using a simple algorithm: for each number in the list, I will check if the difference between the target and that number exists in the rest of the list.\n\nACTION: None required, proceeding with logic.\n\nTHINK: Starting with the first number in the list, which is 8. The difference between the target (21) and 8 is 13. I will now check if 13 exists in the list after 8.\n\nTHINK: 13 does exist in the list. Therefore, 8 and 13 add up to 21.\n\nFINAL: [8, 13]"
