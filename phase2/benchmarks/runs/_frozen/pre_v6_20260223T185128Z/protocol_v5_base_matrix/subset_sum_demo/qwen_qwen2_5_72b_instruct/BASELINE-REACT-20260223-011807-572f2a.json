Since there are no tools provided, I will have to use a brute force approach or a more efficient algorithm like backtracking to find the solution.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Let's start by trying to find a combination of the numbers that equals the target. I will try adding the numbers in different combinations to see if they can sum up to 56.\n\nTHINK: The given numbers are [4, 13, 18, 19, 21] and the target is 56.

This is less than 56, so let's try adding another number.\n\nTHINK: Adding the next largest number: 40 + 18 = 58. This is too large, so we can't include 18 in this combination.\n\nTHINK: Trying the next largest number: 40 + 13 = 53.
