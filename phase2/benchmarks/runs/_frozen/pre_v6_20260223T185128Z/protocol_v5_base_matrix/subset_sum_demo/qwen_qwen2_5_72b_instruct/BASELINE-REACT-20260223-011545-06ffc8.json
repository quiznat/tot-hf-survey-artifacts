    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find a combination of the given numbers that adds up to the target number, 39. I will start by trying to add the largest numbers first to see if I can reach the target.\n\nACTION: None, as there are no tools available, I will proceed with mental calculations.\n\nTHINK: Let's start with the largest number, 25. If I subtract 25 from 39, I get 14. Now I need to find numbers that add up to 14 from the remaining list [2, 2, 5, 12, 20].\n\nTHINK: The next largest number is 20, but 20 is too large since it exceeds 14. So, I will try the next largest number, which is 12. If I subtract 12 from 14, I get 2.",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None,'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the format for actions when no tools are available. Since no tools are provided, all steps will be reasoned through mental calculation and logical deduction.\n\nTHINK: Continuing from where we left off, we have 25 + 12 = 37, and we need 2 more to reach the target of 39. We can see that 2 is available in the list.\n\nFINAL: [25, 12, 2]"
