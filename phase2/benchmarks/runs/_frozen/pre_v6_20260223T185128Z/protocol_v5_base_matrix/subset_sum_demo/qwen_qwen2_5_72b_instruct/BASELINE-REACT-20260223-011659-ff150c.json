Since there are no external tools available, I will solve this problem using a brute-force approach by checking all possible combinations of three numbers from the list.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: I will start by iterating through the list and for each number, I will try to find two other numbers that sum up to the target minus the current number.\n\nTHINK: Let's start with the first number, 1. We need to find two numbers that sum up to 56 (57 - 1).\n\nTHINK: Checking pairs starting with the second number, 6:\n- 6 + 7 = 13 (not 56)\n- 6 + 11 = 17 (not 56)\n- 6 + 20 =",
