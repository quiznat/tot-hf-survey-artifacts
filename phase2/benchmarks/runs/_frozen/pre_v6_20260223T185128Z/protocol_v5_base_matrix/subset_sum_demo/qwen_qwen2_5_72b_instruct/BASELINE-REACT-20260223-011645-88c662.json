    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find if any two distinct numbers in the list add up to the target number, which is 49 in this case. Given that there are no external tools available, I will use a simple algorithm to check each pair of numbers in the list to see if they sum up to the target.\n\nACTION: None, proceeding with reasoning and computation.\n\nTHINK: The list is already sorted, so I can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the solution. I'll start with one pointer at the beginning of the list (index 0) and another at the end (last index). If the sum of the numbers at these pointers equals the target, I have found my solution. If the sum is less than the target, I'll move the first pointer one step to the right. If the sum is greater than the target, I'll move the second pointer one step to the left. I'll",
