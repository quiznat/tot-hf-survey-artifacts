    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find a combination of the given numbers that can sum up to the target value of 52. Since no external tools are provided, I will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations of the numbers.\n\nACTION: Try combinations of the numbers [3, 10, 14, 15, 25] to see if they sum up to 52.\n\nTHINK: Let's start with the largest possible combinations and work our way down. We can try adding the largest numbers first to see if we can quickly reach or exceed the target.\n\nACTION: Check if any combination of the numbers sums to 52.\n\nTHINK: Let's check the following combinations:\n- 25 + 15 + 10 + 3 = 53 (too high)\n- 25 + 15 + 10 = 50 (",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there are no tools available, I will manually compute the possible combinations of the numbers to find which ones add up to the target value of 52.\n\nTHINK: Let's continue from where we left off. The last combination tried was 25 + 15 + 10 = 50, which is 2 less than 52. Adding 3 would make it 53, which is too high. So, let's try other combinations.\n\nACTION: Check the next possible combinations:\n- 25 + 15 + 12 (not possible as 12 is not in the list)\n- 25 + 14 + 10 + 3 = 52\n\nFINAL: [25, 14, 10, 3]"
