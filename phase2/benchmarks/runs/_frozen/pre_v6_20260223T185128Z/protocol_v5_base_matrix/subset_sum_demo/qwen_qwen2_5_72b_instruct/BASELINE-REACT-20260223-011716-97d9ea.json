Since no tools are available, all steps should be considered as part of my thinking process to solve the problem. Let me continue with the logic to find the combination that sums up to 60.\n\nTHINK: As I previously mentioned, I subtracted the largest number (23) from the target (60), leaving me with 37. Then, I subtracted the next largest number (20) from 37, which leaves me with 17. Now, I need to find a combination of the remaining numbers that add up to 17.
