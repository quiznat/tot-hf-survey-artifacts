Since no tools are available, I will use a brute force method to generate all possible combinations and check if any of them add up to 38.\n\nACTION: None needed, proceeding with reasoning.\n\nTHINK: The brute force approach involves checking every possible subset of the list of numbers to see if their sum equals the target. However, since the list is relatively small, this is feasible.
