    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find a combination of the given numbers that sums up to the target number, 79. Since no external tools are available, I will perform the calculation manually by trying different combinations.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Let's start by adding the largest numbers and see if we can get close to the target.\n\nTHINK: 24 + 20 = 44, which is less than 79. Let's add the next largest number.\n\nTHINK: 44 + 19 = 63, still less than 79. Let's try adding the next largest number.\n\nTHINK: 63 + 16 = 79, which is exactly the target number. We have found a valid combination.\n\nFINAL: [24, 20, 19, 16]"
