    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem without any tools, I need to find a combination of the numbers [5, 5, 7, 7, 10] that adds up to the target number 29. I will start by trying to use the largest numbers first to see if they can get close to or reach the target.\n\nACTION: None needed, proceeding with reasoning.\n\nTHINK: Starting with the largest number, 10. If I use 10, I need 19 more to reach 29. The next largest number is 7. Using two 7s would give me 14, which when added to 10 gives 24, still 5 short of 29. Noticing that 5 is available in the list, I can use it to make up the difference. So, 10 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 29",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there are no tools to use, I will continue with the mental calculation. I've determined that using the numbers 10, 7, 7, and 5 from the list [5, 5, 7, 7, 10] adds up to the target number 29 (10 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 29). This combination meets the requirement.\n\nFINAL: [10, 7, 7, 5]"
