Since the list is small, I can look for complements: for each number x, check if (43 - x) exists in the list.\n\n- For 9: need 34 \u2192 not in list  \n- For 10: need 33 \u2192 not in list  \n- For 13: need 30 \u2192 not in list  \n- For 21: need 22 \u2192 22 is in the list!  \n- For 21 (second occurrence): need 22 \u2192 still present  \n- For 22: need 21 \u2192 21 appears twice, so yes  \n- For 24: need 19 \u2192 not in list  \n\nSo valid pairs: (21, 22) \u2014 and since 21 appears twice, there are two instances of this pair, but the task likely just requires",
