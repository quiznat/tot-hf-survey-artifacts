    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a set of numbers [7, 16, 19, 20, 24] and a target 79. The task is likely to combine these numbers (using arithmetic operations, possibly each exactly once) to reach the target. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning puzzle \u2014 likely an \"express target using given numbers and operations\" problem (similar to the 24 game or Countdown numbers round).\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations.\n\nWe need to reach 79 using 7, 16, 19, 20, 24.\n\nTry summing all: 7 + 16 + 19 + 20 + 24 = 86 \u2192 too high by 7.\n\nTry 24 + 20 + 19 = 63; 79 - 63 = 16 \u2192",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: We need to combine [7, 16, 19, 20, 24] to get 79. Let\u2019s consider possible combinations.  \nSum of all = 86, which is 7 more than 79 \u2192 so if we subtract 7, we get 79: 16 + 19 + 20 + 24 = 79. Wait: 16 + 19 = 35, +20 = 55, +24 = 79. Yes! That\u2019s exactly 79, and we used 16, 19, 20, 24 \u2014 but we haven\u2019t used 7 yet. The problem likely requires using *all* numbers exactly once (standard in such puzzles unless stated otherwise). So using only four numbers is invalid.\n\nTry using all five numbers with operations",

So we need to incorporate 7 in a neutral way (e.g., \u00d71, +0, \u22120) or adjust the expression.\n\nIdea: Can we do something like (16 + 19 + 20 + 24) + (7 \u2212 7) = 79? But that uses 7 twice \u2014 not allowed.\n\nAlternative: Use 7 in multiplication/division to create 1 or 0. For example, 7 \u00f7 7 = 1, but only one",

So we need a different approach.\n\nTry combining numbers differently:  \nConsider 24 + 20 = 44  \n79 \u2212 44 = 35 \u2192 can we make 35 from [7, 16, 19]?  \n16 + 19 = 35 \u2014 yes!
