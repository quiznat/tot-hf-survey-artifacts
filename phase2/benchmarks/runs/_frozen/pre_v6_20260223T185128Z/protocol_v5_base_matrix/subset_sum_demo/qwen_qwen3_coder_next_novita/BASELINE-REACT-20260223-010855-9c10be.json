    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24] and a target: 62. We need to find a combination (likely using arithmetic operations) to reach 62. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning problem \u2014 possibly subset sum (sum of some numbers = 62), or using operations like +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses.\n\nFirst, check if any subset sums to 62.\n\nTotal sum of all numbers: 2 + 6 = 8; 8 + 14 = 22; 22 + 18 = 40; 40 + 22 = 62; 62 + 24 = 86. So sum of first five numbers: 2 + 6 + 14 +",

So if we exclude 24, the sum of the remaining numbers is 62. Let's verify: 2 + 6 = 8; 8 + 14 = 22; 22 + 18 = 40; 40 + 22 = 62. Yes! So the subset [2, 6, 14, 18, 22] sums to 62. Therefore, the solution is to select those numbers. Since the task likely asks for a combination (e.g., subset sum), this satisfies it.",
