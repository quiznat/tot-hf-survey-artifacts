    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers [1, 14, 14, 16, 17] and a target of 61. The task is likely to combine these numbers using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, possibly parentheses) to reach the target. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning puzzle.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations.\n\nFirst, sum all numbers: 1 + 14 + 14 + 16 + 17 = 62 \u2014 just 1 more than 61. Interesting.\n\nSo sum = 62, target = 61 \u2192 need to reduce by 1.\n\nWe have a 1 in the list. If instead of adding 1, we subtract it, we get 62 - 2 = 60 \u2014 too low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use multiplication or other operations.\n\nTry:",

Let's consider grouping: 17 + 16 = 33; 14 + 14 = 28; 33 + 28 = 61 \u2014 that\u2019s 17 + 16 + 14 + 14 = 61, and we still have the 1 left. But we must use *all* numbers (standard in such puzzles unless stated otherwise). So we need to include the 1 in a neutral way \u2014 e.g., multiply by 1 or add and subtract it elsewhere.\n\nTry: (17 + 16 + 14 + 14",

For example: (17 + 16 + 14 + 14) \u00d7 1 = 61 \u00d7 1 = 61. That uses all numbers exactly once and yields 61. Let's verify: 17 + 16 = 33; 14 + 14 = 28; 33 + 28 = 61; 61 \u00d7 1 = 61. Yes! So the expression is (17 + 16 + 14 + 14) \u00d7 1 =",
