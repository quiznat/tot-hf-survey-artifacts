    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [4, 6, 7, 15, 18, 22, 22] and a target: 61.

Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning problem.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a subset that sums to 61.\n\nFirst, total sum of all numbers:  \n4 + 6 = 10  \n10 + 7 = 17  \n17 + 15 = 32  \n32 + 18 = 50  \n50 + 22 = 72  \n72 + 22 = 94  \nSo total sum = 94.
