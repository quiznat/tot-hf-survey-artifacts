    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 51 using the numbers [5, 10, 11, 13, 17] with no tools available \u2014 implying we must use arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses) on the given numbers, likely each used exactly once. Let's explore combinations.\n\nFirst, sum all numbers: 5 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 17 = 56 \u2014 close to 51, but 5 more.\n\n56 - 5 = 51 \u2192 so if we can subtract 5, but 5 is already used.

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of 17 + 13 + 11 + 10 = 51, which matches the target exactly. That uses four numbers: 10, 11, 13, 17. But the task likely requires using *all* given numbers [5, 10, 11, 13, 17] exactly once. Let\u2019s verify: if we must use all five, then we need to incorporate 5 in a neutral way (e.g., \u00d71 or +0), but we don\u2019t have extra numbers to make 1 or 0 without changing the total.\n\nAlternative: Try using all five numbers.  \nWe saw total sum = 56. Need to reduce by 5 \u2192 subtract 5, but 5 is already in the sum. So maybe: (sum of others) + 5 \u2212 5 = 5",

Alternatively, use multiplication or division to neutralize the extra 5.\n\nTry: (17 + 13 + 11 + 10) = 51, and we still have 5 left. Can we do something like \u00d7(5/5) = \u00d71?

For example, (17 + 13 + 11 + 10) + (5 \u2212 5) = 51 + 0 = 51 \u2014 but again, only one 5 available.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we do: 17 + 13 +",
