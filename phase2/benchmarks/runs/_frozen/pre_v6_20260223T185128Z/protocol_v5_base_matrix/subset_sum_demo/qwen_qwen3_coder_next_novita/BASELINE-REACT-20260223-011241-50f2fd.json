Since no tools are available, this is likely a puzzle requiring arithmetic operations on a subset of numbers. I found that 20 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 28, and all those numbers (1, 3, 4, 20) are present in the list (we have two 3s, so using one is fine). This is a valid solution using four numbers. Let me verify: 20 + 4 = 24, 24 + 3 = 27, 27 + 1 = 28. Correct. No need for other numbers or operations.",
