    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 48 using the given list of numbers [1, 5, 8, 15, 16, 19, 24, 25] and basic arithmetic operations (since no tools are provided, we assume standard operations: +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses). We need to find an expression using some or all of these numbers (each used at most once) that evaluates to 48.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations.\n\nFirst, note that 24 + 25 = 49 \u2014 close to 48, just 1 over. So 24 + 25 \u2212 1 = 48. That uses 24, 25, and 1 \u2014 all in the list.\n\nCheck: 24 + 25 = 49; 49 \u2212 1 =",
