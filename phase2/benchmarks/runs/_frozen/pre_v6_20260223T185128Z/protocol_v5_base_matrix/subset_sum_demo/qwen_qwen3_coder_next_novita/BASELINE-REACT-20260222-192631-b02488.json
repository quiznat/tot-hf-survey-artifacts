    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The error message suggests a misunderstanding \u2014 perhaps the system expects a tool call, but no tools are available. However, the task is clearly to find an expression using the given numbers to reach the target. My earlier reasoning found a valid expression: 18 - 8 - 2 + 1 = 9. Let me verify again: 18 - 8 = 10; 10 - 2 = 8; 8 + 1 = 9. Correct. All numbers used are from the list, each used once (1, 2, 8, 18 \u2014 22 is unused, but typically such puzzles allow unused numbers unless specified otherwise). Since no tools are available, the final answer should be the expression or the result. The task likely expects the answer as the expression or confirmation. Given the format, FINAL should contain the answer \u2014 likely the expression or just \"9\"",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 9 using the numbers [1, 2, 8, 18, 22] with arithmetic operations, each number used at most once. I previously found that 18 - 8 - 2 + 1 = 9, which is correct: 18 - 8 = 10; 10 - 2 = 8; 8 + 1 = 9. All numbers used (1, 2, 8, 18) are from the list, and 22 is unused \u2014 acceptable unless the problem requires using all numbers, which is not stated. Since no tools are available, the solution is the expression itself. The expected output format is likely the expression or confirmation of reaching the target. Given the benchmark context, the final answer should be the expression that yields 9.\nFINAL: 18 -"
