    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a way to reach the target number 30 using the given list of numbers [1, 4, 8, 9, 9, 10, 16, 21]. Since no tools are available, this is likely a puzzle where we need to combine numbers using arithmetic operations (e.g., +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, concatenation, or selecting a subset). Let's explore possibilities.\n\nFirst, check if any subset sums to 30:\n- Try combinations:\n  - 21 + 9 = 30 \u2192 yes! There are two 9s, so 21 + 9 = 30 works.\n  - 16 + 10 + 4 = 30 \u2192 16+10+4 = 30, also valid.\n  - 9 + 9 + 8 +",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target 30 using numbers [1, 4, 8, 9, 9, 10, 16, 21]. Since no tools are available, we must find an expression using arithmetic operations (and possibly subset selection). As noted, 21 + 9 = 30, and there are two 9s, so that's a valid solution. Alternatively, 16 + 10 + 4 = 30, or 9 + 9 + 8 + 4 = 30, etc. Since the problem likely just requires *finding* a way (not necessarily using all numbers), the simplest is 21 + 9 = 30. We can confirm this uses numbers from the list: 21 and one of the 9s are present. So the answer is achievable.",
