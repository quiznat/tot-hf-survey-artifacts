    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24] and a target: 62. We need to find a combination (likely using arithmetic operations) to reach 62. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning puzzle \u2014 possibly using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, concatenation, or exponentiation, but typically in such benchmarks, basic arithmetic and possibly parentheses are allowed.\n\nLet\u2019s explore sums first:\n- Sum of all numbers: 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 = 86 \u2192 too high.\n- Try subsets:\n  - 24 + 22 = 46; 62 - 46 = 16 \u2192 do we have 16? No, but 14 + 2 =",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let\u2019s continue exploring combinations. Sum of all numbers is 86, which is 24 more than 62. So maybe removing some numbers (i.e., using subtraction) could help. Alternatively, try combinations that sum to 62 directly.\n\nCheck possible subsets:\n- 24 + 22 + 14 = 60 \u2192 need +2 \u2192 we have 2! So 24 + 22 + 14 + 2 = 62. That\u2019s 4 numbers: 2, 14, 22, 24.\n\nLet\u2019s verify: 2 + 14 = 16; 16 + 22 = 38; 38 + 24 = 62. Yes! Perfect.\n\nSo the solution is: 2 + 14 + 22 + 24 = 6",
