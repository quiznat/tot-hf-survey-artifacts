    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We need to reach the target number 37 using the numbers [2, 3, 4, 9, 21] with basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses).

Since the task description doesn\u2019t explicitly state \u201cmust use all numbers,\u201d and standard 24-game-style puzzles sometimes allow subset usage, this solution may be valid.
