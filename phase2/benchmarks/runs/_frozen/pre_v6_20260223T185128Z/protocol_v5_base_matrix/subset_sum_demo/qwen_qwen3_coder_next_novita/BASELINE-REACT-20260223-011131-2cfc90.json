    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a way to reach the target number 48 using the given list of numbers [1, 5, 8, 15, 16, 19, 24, 25]. Since no tools are available, this is likely a puzzle where we need to combine numbers using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) \u2014 possibly using each number at most once.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations.\n\nFirst, note the target: 48.\n\nLook at large numbers: 24 + 25 = 49 \u2192 close to 48, just 1 over. So 24 + 25 - 1 = 48. That uses 24, 25, and 1 \u2014 all in the list.\n\nCheck: 24 + 25 = 49; 49 - 1 =",
