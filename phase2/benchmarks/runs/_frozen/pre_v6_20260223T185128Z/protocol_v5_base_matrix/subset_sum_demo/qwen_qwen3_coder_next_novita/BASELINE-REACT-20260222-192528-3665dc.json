    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a pair of numbers from the list `[10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 19, 20]` that sum to the target `37`. Let's check possible pairs:\n\n- 10 + 27 = 37 \u2192 27 not in list  \n- 13 + 24 = 37 \u2192 24 not in list  \n- 14 + 23 = 37 \u2192 23 not in list  \n- 17 + 20 = 37 \u2192 20 is in the list! \u2705  \n- 18 + 19 = 37 \u2192 18 and 19 are both in the list (there are two 19s, so 18 + 19 is valid)",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: We have identified two valid pairs that sum to 37: (17, 20) and (18, 19). Since the task likely expects any one valid pair (or possibly all), but no specific instruction is given, we can return one pair. Let's choose (17, 20) as it was the first identified. Alternatively, (18, 19) is also valid and uses the duplicate 19. Either is acceptable. Since the problem doesn\u2019t specify uniqueness or ordering, we\u2019ll output one pair.\nFINAL: [17, 20]"
