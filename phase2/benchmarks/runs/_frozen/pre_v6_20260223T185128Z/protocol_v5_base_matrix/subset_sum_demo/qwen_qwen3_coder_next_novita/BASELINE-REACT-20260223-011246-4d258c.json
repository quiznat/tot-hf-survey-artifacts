    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [4, 4, 6, 12, 12, 12, 14, 15] and a target of 22.

Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning problem.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possible combinations:\n\n- Try two numbers:  \n  - 15 + 6 = 21  \n  - 15 + 4 = 19  \n  - 14 + 6 = 20  \n  - 14 + 4 = 18  \n  - 12 + 12 = 24  \n  - 12 + 6 = 18  \n  - 12 + 4 = 16  \n  - 6 +",

Pairs summing to 8: 4+4=8 \u2192 yes! So 14 + 4 + 4 = 22. Check availability: there are two 4s in the list \u2014 yes, exactly two. So [4, 4, 14] sums to 22.\n\nThus, a valid subset exists: 4 + 4",
