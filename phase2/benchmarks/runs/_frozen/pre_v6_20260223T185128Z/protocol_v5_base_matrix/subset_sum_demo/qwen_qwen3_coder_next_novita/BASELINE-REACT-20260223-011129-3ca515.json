    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a combination of numbers from the list [7, 10, 11, 18, 21, 22, 22, 23] that sum to the target 39. Since no tools are available, I need to reason manually.\n\nLet\u2019s look for pairs or triples that sum to 39.\n\nFirst, try two numbers:\n- 7 + 32? No 32.\n- 10 + 29? No 29.\n- 11 + 28? No.\n- 18 + 21 = 39 \u2192 Yes! Both 18 and 21 are in the list.\n\nCheck: list has 18 and 21 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo one valid solution is 18 + 21 = 39.\n\nThus, the answer is [18",

Since the task only requires finding *a* combination (not necessarily all), this suffices. I should now provide the final answer as the combination found.",
