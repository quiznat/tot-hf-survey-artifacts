    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We need to use the numbers [2, 2, 5, 10, 22, 23] with arithmetic operations to reach the target 40. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning/puzzle task \u2014 likely using +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses. Let's explore combinations.\n\nFirst, note the numbers: two 2s, 5, 10, 22, 23.\n\nTry to get close to 40.\n\nObservation: 22 + 23 = 45 \u2192 too high by 5. We have a 5! So 22 + 23 \u2212 5 = 40. That uses 22, 23, and 5 \u2014 but we still have [2, 2, 10] unused. The problem likely requires using *all* numbers",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The target is 40, and we must use all numbers [2, 2, 5, 10, 22, 23] exactly once with arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses). My earlier idea 22 + 23 \u2212 5 = 40 uses only three numbers \u2014 need to incorporate the remaining 2, 2, and 10. Perhaps we can create a neutral term (e.g., \u00d71 or +0) using the extra numbers.\n\nIdea: Can we make 0 from [2, 2, 10]? 2 + 2 \u2212 4 = 0, but no 4. 10 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 \u2212 6 = 0 \u2014 no 6.

Let\u2019s try to incorporate them via multiplication by 1 or addition of 0.\n\nWe can make 1 from (2 / 2), so maybe: (22 + 23 \u2212 5) \u00d7 (2 / 2) = 40 \u00d7 1 = 40, but then 10 is still unused.\n\nAlternatively, make 0 from (10 \u2212 10), but we only have one 10.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we do something like: 22 + 23 \u2212 5 + (2 \u2212 2) \u00d7 1",

To incorporate them, we can try to create a neutral factor (\u00d71) or additive zero (+0). We can get 1 from (2 / 2), but then 10 remains. Alternatively, can we absorb 10 via subtraction/addition with others? Try: (23 \u2212 10) = 13, (22 + 5) = 27, 27 + 13 = 40 \u2014 that\u2019s 23, 10, 22, 5 used, leaving [2, 2]. Again,",
