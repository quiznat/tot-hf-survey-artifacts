Since no tools are available, I need to reason manually.\n\nLet me try combinations:\n\nStart with larger numbers to get close to 39 quickly.\n\nTry 23 + 18 = 41 \u2192 too high  \n23 + 11 = 34 \u2192 need 5 more \u2192 no 5  \n23 + 10 = 33 \u2192 need 6 \u2192 no 6  \n23 + 7 = 30 \u2192 need 9 \u2192 no 9  \n23 + 21 = 44 \u2192 too high  \n23 + 22 = 45 \u2192 too high  \n23 + 22",

Since 23 + 11 = 34, and we have two 22s and another 7, 10, etc., maybe try three numbers.\n\nTry 18 + 11 + 10 = 39 \u2192 yes! 18 + 11 = 29, +10 = 39. All three numbers are in the list: 18, 11, and 10 are present.\n\nConfirm list: [7, 10, 11, 18, 21, 22, 22, 23] \u2014 yes, 10, 11, and 18 are all there.\n\nSo a valid combination is 10 + 11 + 18 = 39.\n\nFINAL: 10 + 11 +"
