    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [5, 17, 17, 18, 20, 24] and a target sum of 76. The task likely asks to find a subset (or combination) of these numbers that sum to the target. Since no tools are available, we must compute manually.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a subset that sums to 76.\n\nFirst, compute total sum:  \n5 + 17 + 17 + 18 + 20 + 24 =  \n5 + 17 = 22  \n22 + 17 = 39  \n39 + 18 = 57  \n57 + 20 = 77  \n77 + 24 = 101  \nTotal = 101.
