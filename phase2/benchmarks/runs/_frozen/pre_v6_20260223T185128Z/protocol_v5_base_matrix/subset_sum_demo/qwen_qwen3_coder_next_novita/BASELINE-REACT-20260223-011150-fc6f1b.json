    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We need to use the numbers [1, 2, 5, 14, 17, 18] to make 24, using standard arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses). This is a variant of the 24 game, but with 6 numbers instead of 4. Let's explore combinations.\n\nFirst, note that 18 + 5 + 1 = 24, but then we\u2019d have leftover numbers 2, 14, 17 \u2014 we must use *all* numbers exactly once.\n\nSo we need an expression using all six numbers exactly once to equal 24.\n\nLet\u2019s consider grouping or canceling: maybe (18 + 17 + 5) \u2212 (14 + 2 + 1) = 40 \u2212 17 = 23 \u2014 close.\n\n(18 + 1",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Let's try a more systematic approach. Since 24 is relatively small compared to the sum of all numbers (1+2+5+14+17+18 = 57), we likely need subtraction or division to reduce the total. Consider pairing numbers to get useful intermediate values.\n\nNote: 18 + 17 = 35, 14 + 5 = 19, 35 \u2212 19 = 16.
