    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a way to combine the given numbers [1, 2, 8, 18, 22] to reach the target value 9. Since no tools are available, I can only use basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on the numbers.\n\nLet me try different combinations systematically:\n\nFirst, let me see if I can get 9 by subtracting some numbers from others:\n- 22 - 18 = 4, then I have 1, 2, 8 left. Can I make 9 from 4, 1, 2, 8?\n- 18 - 8 = 10, then I have 1, 2, 22 left. Can I make 9 from 10, 1, 2, 22?\n\nLet me try: 22 - 18",

I need to make 9 from these, but 4 + 1 + 2 + 8 = 15 which is too large, and 8 - 2 - 1 = 5, which doesn't help.\n\nLet me try another approach: 18 - 8 = 10, leaving 1, 2, 22. \nIf I take 22 - 10 = 12, I still need to incorporate 1 and 2 somehow.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: what about 22 - 18 + 8 - 2 - 1?\n= 4 + 8 - 3 = 9\n\nLet me verify: 22 -",
