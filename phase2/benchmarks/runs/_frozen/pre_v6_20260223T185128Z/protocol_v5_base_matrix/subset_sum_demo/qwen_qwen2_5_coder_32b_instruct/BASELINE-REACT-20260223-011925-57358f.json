Since no tools are available, I'll have to solve this manually by trying different combinations.\n\nLet me start by looking for combinations systematically:\n- If I use the largest number 21, I need the remaining numbers to sum to 33-21=12\n- If I use 17, I need remaining numbers to sum to 33-17=16\n- If I use 14, I need remaining numbers to sum to 33-14=19\n- And so on...\n\nLet me try combinations that include 21:\nNeed to make 12 from [5, 6, 1",
