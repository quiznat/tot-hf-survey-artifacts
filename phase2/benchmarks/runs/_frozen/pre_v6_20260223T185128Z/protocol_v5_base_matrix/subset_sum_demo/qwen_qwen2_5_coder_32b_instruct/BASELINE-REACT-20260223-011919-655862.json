    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find if there's a combination of numbers from the given list that sum up to the target value of 17. Since no tools are available, I'll have to work through this manually by checking different combinations.\n\nLet me examine the numbers: [1, 5, 8, 16, 21, 22, 23] and target: 17\n\nI'll start by looking for single numbers that equal 17 - there isn't one.\nThen I'll check pairs of numbers:\n- 1 + 5 = 6\n- 1 + 8 = 9\n- 1 + 16 = 17 \u2713\n\nI found that 1 + 16 = 17, so the answer is yes, there is a combination that sums to the target.\n\nFINAL: Yes, the numbers 1 and 16 from the list"
