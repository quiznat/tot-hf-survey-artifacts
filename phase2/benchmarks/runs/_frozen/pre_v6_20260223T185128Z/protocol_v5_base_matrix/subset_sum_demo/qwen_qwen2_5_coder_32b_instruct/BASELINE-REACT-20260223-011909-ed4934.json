Since no tools are available, I'll have to solve this manually by trying different combinations.\n\nLet me start by looking for combinations that might work:\n- The largest numbers are 22 and 22, so let's see if we can use those\n- 22 + 22 = 44, which leaves us with 17 more needed\n- Looking at remaining numbers [4, 6, 7, 15, 18], I need to make 17\n- 15 + 4 = 19 (too big) or 7 + 6 + 4 = 17 (this works!)",

Let me also check if there are other possible combinations to be thorough.\n\nAnother approach: 18 + 15 + 22 + 22 + 4 = 81 (too big)\nOr: 18 + 15 + 22 + 7 = 62 (close but too big)\nOr: 18 + 15 + 22 + 6 = 61 (this also works!)\n\nSo I have at least two valid combinations:\n1. 22 +",
