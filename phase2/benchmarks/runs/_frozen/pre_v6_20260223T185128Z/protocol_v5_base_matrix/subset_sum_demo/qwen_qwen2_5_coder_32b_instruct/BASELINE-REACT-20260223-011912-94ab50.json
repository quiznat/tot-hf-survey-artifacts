Let me analyze the numbers: [6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, 18, 22]. \n\nSince I don't have any tools available, I'll need to work through this manually by trying different combinations. Let me start by looking for obvious combinations or patterns.\n\nFirst, let me see if I can find a subset that sums to 49 by trying different approaches:\n- The largest numbers are 22 and 18, so maybe I can use those\n- 22 + 18 = 40, so I need 9 more\n- Looking at remaining numbers: 6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18\n- Can I make 9",

Looking at remaining numbers [6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18], I can't make 9 exactly with any single number.\n\nLet me try other combinations:\n- 18 + 18 = 36, need 13 more\n- If I use 13, that gives me 36 + 13 = 49 \u2713\n\nSo one possible solution is: 18 + 18 + 13 = 49\n\nLet me verify: 18 + 18 + 13 = 36 + 13 = 49 \u2713\n\nThis uses three numbers from the list:",
