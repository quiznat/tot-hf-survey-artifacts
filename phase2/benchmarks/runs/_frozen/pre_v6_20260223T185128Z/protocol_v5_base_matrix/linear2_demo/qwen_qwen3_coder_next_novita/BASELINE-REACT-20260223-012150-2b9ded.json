    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of two equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -1x - 8y = 29  \nEquation 2: 4x - 7y = 1  \n\nWe need to solve this system of two linear equations for x and y.\n\nLet\u2019s solve using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.\n\nMultiply Equation 1 by 4 to align coefficients of x with Equation 2:\nEquation 1 \u00d7 4: -4x - 32y = 116  \nEquation 2:      4x - 7y = 1  \n\nAdd the two equations:\n(-4x + 4x) + (-32y - 7y) = 116 + 1  \n\u2192 0",
