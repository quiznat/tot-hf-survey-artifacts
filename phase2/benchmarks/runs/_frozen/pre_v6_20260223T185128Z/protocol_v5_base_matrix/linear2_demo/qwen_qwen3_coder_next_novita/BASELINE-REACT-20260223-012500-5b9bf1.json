    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations of the form ax + by = c. The input is [[9, 9, 99], [-7, 5, 19]]. So we have:\n\n1) 9x + 9y = 99  \n2) -7x + 5y = 19\n\nWe need to solve this system of equations for x and y.\n\nFirst, simplify equation (1): divide both sides by 9 \u2192 x + y = 11 \u2192 so y = 11 - x.\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):  \n-7x + 5(11 - x) = 19  \n-7x + 55 - 5x = 19  \n-12x + 55 = 19  \n-12x =",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the algebra:  \n-12x + 55 = 19  \n\u2192 -12x = 19 - 55 = -36  \n\u2192 x = (-36)/(-12) = 3  \n\nThen y = 11 - x = 11 - 3 = 8  \n\nSo the solution is x = 3, y = 8. Let\u2019s verify with the second equation:  \n-7(3) + 5(8) = -21 + 40 = 19 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nThus, the answer is x = 3, y = 8. Since the task likely expects the solution as an ordered pair or values, I\u2019ll present it as (3, 8).",
