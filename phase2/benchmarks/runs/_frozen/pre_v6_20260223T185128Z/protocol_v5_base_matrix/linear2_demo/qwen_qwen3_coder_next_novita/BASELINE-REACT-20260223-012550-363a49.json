    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations in two variables: a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) 5x - y = 31  \n2) 3x + 4y = 14  \n\nWe need to solve this system of equations. Let's solve it manually.\n\nFrom equation (1):  \n5x - y = 31 \u2192 y = 5x - 31\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):  \n3x + 4(5x - 31) = 14  \n3x + 20x - 124 = 14  \n23x = 138  \nx = 138 / 23 = 6\n\nThen y = 5(6) - 31 = 30 -",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the calculation: y = 5(6) - 31 = 30 - 31 = -1. So the solution is x = 6, y = -1. Let's verify with the second equation: 3(6) + 4(-1) = 18 - 4 = 14, which matches. The solution is correct. Since no tools are available and the task is to solve the system, the final answer is the pair (x, y) = (6, -1).",
