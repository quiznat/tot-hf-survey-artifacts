    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations of the form ax + by = c. We have two equations:  \n1) 3x + 2y = 17  \n2) 9x - 7y = 116  \n\nWe need to solve this system for x and y. Let's solve it manually using elimination or substitution.\n\nFirst, let's try elimination. Multiply the first equation by 3 to align coefficients of x with the second equation:  \n3*(3x + 2y) = 3*17 \u2192 9x + 6y = 51  \n\nNow subtract the second equation (9x - 7y = 116) from this new equation:  \n(9x + 6y) - (9x - 7y) = 51 - 1",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the elimination method:  \n(9x + 6y) - (9x - 7y) = 51 - 116  \n\u2192 9x + 6y - 9x + 7y = -65  \n\u2192 13y = -65  \n\u2192 y = -5  \n\nNow substitute y = -5 into the first equation:  \n3x + 2(-5) = 17  \n\u2192 3x - 10 = 17  \n\u2192 3x = 27  \n\u2192 x = 9  \n\nCheck with the second equation:  \n9x - 7y = 9(9) - 7(-5) = 81 + 35 = 116 \u2713  \n\nSo the solution is x = 9, y = -5.  \nThe task likely expects the answer as an ordered pair (",
