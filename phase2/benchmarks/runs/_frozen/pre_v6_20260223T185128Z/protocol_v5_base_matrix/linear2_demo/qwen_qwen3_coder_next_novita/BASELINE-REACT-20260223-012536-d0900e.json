    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides a list of linear equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c. Here, we have two equations:  \n1) -9x + 1y = -75  \n2) -8x - 3y = -90  \n\nWe need to solve this system for x and y. Let's solve it manually using substitution or elimination.\n\nLet\u2019s use elimination. First, write the equations clearly:\n\n(1) -9x + y = -75  \n(2) -8x - 3y = -90  \n\nFrom (1), solve for y:  \ny = 9x - 75  \n\nSubstitute into (2):  \n-8x - 3(9x - 75) = -90  \n\u2192 -8x - 27x + 225 = -90  \n\u2192",
