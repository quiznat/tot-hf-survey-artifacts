    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in two variables, represented as coefficient arrays. Each inner list has the form [a, b, c] corresponding to the equation a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n- Equation 1: -3x + 4y = 19\n- Equation 2: -2x + 4y = 18\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let's subtract or eliminate variables. Notice both equations have +4y, so subtracting them will eliminate y.\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n(-3x + 4y) - (-2x + 4y) = 19 - 18  \n\u2192 -3x + 4y + 2x - 4y = 1  \n\u2192 (-x) = 1  \n\u2192 x = -1\n\nNow substitute x = -",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From the scratchpad, we have x = -1. Now substitute x = -1 into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use equation 2: -2x + 4y = 18. Substituting x = -1 gives: -2(-1) + 4y = 18 \u2192 2 + 4y = 18 \u2192 4y = 16 \u2192 y = 4. So the solution is x = -1, y = 4. Let's verify with equation 1: -3(-1) + 4(4) = 3 + 16 = 19, which matches the RHS. Correct. Final answer is x = -1, y = 4.",
