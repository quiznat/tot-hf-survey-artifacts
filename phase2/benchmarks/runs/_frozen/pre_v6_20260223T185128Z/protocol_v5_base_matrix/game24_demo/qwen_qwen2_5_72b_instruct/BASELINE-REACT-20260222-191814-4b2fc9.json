Without this information, I cannot determine the appropriate action or final answer.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Since no further instructions or tools are provided, and the task input is just a list of numbers without a specific goal, I will assume a common task for such inputs: finding the maximum value in the list.\n\nACTION: FindMax [2, 1, 6, 4]\n\nTHINK: After evaluating the list, the maximum value is 6.\n\nFINAL: 6",
