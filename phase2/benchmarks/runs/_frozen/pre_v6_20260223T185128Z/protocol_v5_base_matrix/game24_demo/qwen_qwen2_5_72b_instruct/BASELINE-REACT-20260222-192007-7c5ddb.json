Is it to sort the list, find the sum, or identify unique elements?\n\nTHINK: Given the nature of the input, a common task might be to sort the list in ascending order, as this is a frequent operation for lists of numbers.\n\nACTION: THINK Should I proceed with sorting the list as the final answer?\n\nTHINK: Sorting the list seems like a reasonable assumption, so I will sort the list [10, 2",
