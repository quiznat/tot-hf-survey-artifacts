    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers, and since no specific task or question is provided, I need to determine what needs to be done with this list. Common tasks for lists of numbers include sorting, finding the maximum or minimum value, calculating the sum, or computing the average. Without more context, I'll start by sorting the list, as it's a basic and useful operation.\n\nACTION: None sort [4, 10, 7, 3]\n\nTHINK: Since there are no available tools, I will perform the sorting manually.\n\nACTION: None [3, 4, 7, 10]\n\nTHINK: The list has been sorted. Now, I should consider if there is any additional information or context that would help me determine the next step. Since no further instructions are provided, I will assume that the task is to return the sorted list.\n\nFINAL: [3, 4, 7",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Given that there are no available tools and the task input is a list of numbers, the most straightforward action is to manually process the list. Since no specific task is mentioned, sorting the list seems like a reasonable action. However, since the previous attempt to sort the list resulted in an error due to the misuse of the \"None\" placeholder, I will directly provide the sorted list as the final answer without using the ACTION format incorrectly.\n\nFINAL: [3, 4, 7, 10]"
