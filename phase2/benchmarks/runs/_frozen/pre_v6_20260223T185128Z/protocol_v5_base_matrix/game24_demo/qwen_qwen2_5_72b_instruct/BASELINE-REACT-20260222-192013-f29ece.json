Common tasks with such inputs include finding the sum, product, maximum, minimum, or sorting the numbers. Without additional context, I will assume the task is to find the sum of the numbers as it's one of the simplest and most common operations.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: To solve this, I will manually add up the numbers in the list [9, 9, 2, 4].\n\nFINAL: 24",
