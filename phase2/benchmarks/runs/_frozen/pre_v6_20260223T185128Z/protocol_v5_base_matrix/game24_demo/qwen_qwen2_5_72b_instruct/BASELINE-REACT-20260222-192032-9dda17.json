Here's how I would do it:\n\n1. Compare 9 and 3. Since 9 > 3, swap them: [3, 9, 5, 4].\n2. Compare 9 and 5. Since 9 > 5, swap them: [3, 5, 9, 4].\n3. Compare 9 and 4. Since 9 > 4, swap them: [3, 5, 4, 9].\n4. Now the largest number (9) is at the end. Repeat the process for the remaining elements: [3,",
