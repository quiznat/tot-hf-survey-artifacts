    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers, and since no specific task or question is mentioned, the most common task for such an input would be to process this list in some way. Without any tools available, a simple task could be to find the maximum number in the list. However, since the task is not explicitly stated, I will assume the task is to find the maximum value in the list and provide that as the final answer.\n\nFINAL: 9"
