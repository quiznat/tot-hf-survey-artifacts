Common tasks with such inputs include computing the sum, mean, median, or checking for patterns. From STEP 1, I started computing the sum (19), mean (4.75), and median (4). The list has a repeated 4, so mode is 4. Range is 8 \u2212 3 = 5. However, none of these stand out uniquely. Another common benchmark task is to determine if the numbers can form a valid quadrilateral (e.g., using quadrilateral inequality: sum of any three sides > fourth side).
