    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 10, 6, 4]. Since no tools are available and no specific task is described, I need to infer what the benchmark task might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include: sorting, computing sum, product, mean, median, etc. Given the simplicity and typical patterns, sorting the list in ascending order is a plausible default task. Sorting [2, 10, 6, 4] yields [2, 4, 6, 10]. Alternatively, maybe it's about finding the maximum (10), minimum (2), or sum (22). But without explicit instructions, the most neutral and common operation is sorting. Let me double-check: sorted([2,10,6,4]) = [2,4,6,10]. That seems reasonable. I'll go with that as the answer",
