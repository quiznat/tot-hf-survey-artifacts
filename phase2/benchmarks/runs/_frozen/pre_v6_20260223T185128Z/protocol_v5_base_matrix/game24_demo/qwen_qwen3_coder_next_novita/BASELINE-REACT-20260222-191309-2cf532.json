    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [7, 9, 6, 6]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". In many benchmark tasks involving numbers, common objectives include computing the sum, product, average, sorting, finding min/max, or checking for patterns (e.g., duplicates).

In such ambiguous cases, common expectations include computing a simple aggregate like sum, average, or identifying key statistics. Given the list has a repeated value (6 appears twice), and the average is exactly 7 (an integer in the list), the average is a clean candidate. Sum = 28, count = 4, average = 7. Since 7 is also present in the input, this may be intentional. Without further instructions, the most neutral and commonly expected output for a numeric list in benchmark tasks is the sum or average. Given that the average is an integer and matches an element, and sum is straightforward, I\u2019ll choose sum = 28 as a standard first-pass answer.",
