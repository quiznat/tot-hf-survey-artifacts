    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [7, 7, 3, 8], and no tools are available. This suggests the task may be to compute something from these numbers, possibly using arithmetic operations to reach a target (like 24 game), or to find a pattern, sum, product, etc. Since no target is specified, the most basic interpretation is to compute the sum: 7 + 7 + 3 + 8 = 25. Alternatively, maybe it's to sort, find min/max, etc. But without more context, sum is the most straightforward. Let me double-check: 7+7=14, 14+3=17, 17+8=25. Yes. So final answer is 25.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [7, 7, 3, 8], and no tools are available. Since no specific task is given, the most reasonable interpretation is to compute the sum of the numbers, as it's the most fundamental arithmetic operation on a list of numbers. Calculating: 7 + 7 = 14; 14 + 3 = 17; 17 + 8 = 25. Alternatively, could be product (7\u00d77\u00d73\u00d78 = 1176), but sum is simpler and more standard for unspecified tasks. Other possibilities like min (3), max (8), or sorted list [3,7,7,8] are less likely without context. Sum = 25 remains the most plausible answer.",
