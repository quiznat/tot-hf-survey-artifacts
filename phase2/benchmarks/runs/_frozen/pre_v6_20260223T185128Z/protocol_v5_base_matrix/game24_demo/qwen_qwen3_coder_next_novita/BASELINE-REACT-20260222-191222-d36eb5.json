    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [9, 9, 2, 4] and no available tools. Since no tools are provided and no specific task is defined (e.g., arithmetic, sorting, pattern recognition), I need to infer the most likely intended task. Given the numbers [9, 9, 2, 4], a common benchmark task is to compute the result of applying arithmetic operations (e.g., using all numbers once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to reach 24 (the \"24 game\"). Let\u2019s test if that\u2019s possible.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 9 + 9 + 2 + 4 = 24 \u2192 9+9=18, 18+2=20, 20+4=24. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the solution is simply sum",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [9, 9, 2, 4]. A common benchmark task with such inputs is the 24 game, where the goal is to use all numbers exactly once with arithmetic operations to reach 24. Testing simple addition: 9 + 9 + 2 + 4 = 24. This uses all numbers once and yields 24. Since no tools are available and the task is to produce the answer, the solution is 24.",
