Common benchmark tasks with such inputs often involve computing the sum, average, mode, median, or identifying a pattern. Given the repetition of 5 and a single 6, possible interpretations include: sum = 21, average = 5.25, mode = 5, median = 5, range = 1. However, in many benchmark contexts\u2014especially when no operation is specified\u2014the expected answer might be the *sum*, as it's a fundamental arithmetic operation and frequently used in such tasks. Alternatively, it could be asking for the *mode* (most frequent value), which is clearly 5. But without explicit instructions, I should consider if there's a standard convention.

In benchmark tasks like this\u2014especially when given a short list of numbers without context\u2014the most common expectation is to compute the *sum*, as it's a fundamental operation and frequently used in such problems. The sum is 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 21. Other possibilities (e.g., mode = 5, average = 5.25) are less likely to be the default answer without further context.
