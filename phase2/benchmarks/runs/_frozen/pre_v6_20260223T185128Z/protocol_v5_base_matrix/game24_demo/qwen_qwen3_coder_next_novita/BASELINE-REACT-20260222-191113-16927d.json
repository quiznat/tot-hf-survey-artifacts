    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [8, 9, 7, 8]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks include computing the sum, average, min, max, or detecting patterns. Since the numbers are small and the list is short, perhaps the task is to compute the sum. Let\u2019s compute the sum: 8 + 9 + 7 + 8 = 32. Alternatively, maybe it's to sort the list: [7, 8, 8, 9]. But without explicit instructions, the most straightforward interpretation is to return the sum as a typical arithmetic benchmark. I\u2019ll go with sum = 32.",
