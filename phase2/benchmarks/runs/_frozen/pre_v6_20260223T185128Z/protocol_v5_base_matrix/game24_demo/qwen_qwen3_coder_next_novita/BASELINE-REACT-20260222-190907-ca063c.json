    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [7, 9, 8, 5]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks involve sorting, summing, finding min/max, or identifying patterns. Since the numbers are small and the list is short, perhaps the task is to sort them in ascending or descending order. Let\u2019s consider sorting: ascending would be [5, 7, 8, 9]; descending would be [9, 8, 7, 5]. Alternatively, maybe it's to compute the sum: 7 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 29. Or the average: 29 / 4 = 7.25. But without explicit instructions, the most neutral and common interpretation for a list input in benchmark tasks is to sort it. Since the numbers are integers",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [7, 9, 8, 5], with no tools available and no explicit task description. In benchmark tasks, when given a list without further context, sorting is a common default operation. Sorting in ascending order yields [5, 7, 8, 9], which is straightforward and unambiguous. Since no other operations (e.g., sum, product, max) are indicated, and sorting is a standard preprocessing step, this is the most reasonable interpretation. I will proceed with ascending sort as the answer.",
