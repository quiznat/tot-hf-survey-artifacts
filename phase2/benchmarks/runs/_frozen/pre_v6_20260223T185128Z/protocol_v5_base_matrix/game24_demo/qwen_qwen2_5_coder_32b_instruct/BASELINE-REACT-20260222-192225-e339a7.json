    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [7, 3, 5, 1]. Since no tools are available, I need to think through this step by step. The most common benchmark tasks with arrays involve sorting, finding maximum/minimum values, or performing some mathematical operation on the elements.\n\nLooking at the numbers [7, 3, 5, 1], I can see they're not in order. A typical benchmark task might be to sort them in ascending order, find the maximum value, or find the minimum value.\n\nLet me check if there's an obvious pattern or operation that would make sense for this specific set of numbers. \n\nThe simplest approach would be to sort them in ascending order, which is a standard benchmark task.\n\nACTION: sort [7, 3, 5, 1]\n\nWait, I don't have a sort tool available.
