    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the task input [5, 7, 3, 3] and determine what operation or analysis is required. Since no specific task was mentioned beyond providing these numbers, I should consider common operations that could be performed on this set of numbers.\n\nLooking at the numbers [5, 7, 3, 3], I can think about:\n- Finding the sum: 5 + 7 + 3 + 3 = 18\n- Finding the average: (5 + 7 + 3 + 3) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5\n- Finding the maximum value: 7\n- Finding the minimum value: 3\n- Counting occurrences of each number\n\nSince there's no specific instruction given, I'll calculate the sum as it's a fundamental operation that can be easily computed from the provided numbers.\n\nACTION: sum [5",

Looking at the numbers [5, 7, 3, 3], I'll calculate the sum by adding them together: 5 + 7 + 3 + 3 = 18. Since I cannot use any tools, I'll provide the final answer directly.\n\nFINAL: 18"
