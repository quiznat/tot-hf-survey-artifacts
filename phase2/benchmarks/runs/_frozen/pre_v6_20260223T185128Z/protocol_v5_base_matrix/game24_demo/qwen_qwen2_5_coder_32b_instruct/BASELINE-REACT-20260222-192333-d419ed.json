Another possibility is to find the maximum value, which would be 8. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the task is to arrange these numbers in ascending order manually.\n\nSince I cannot use any tools, I'll manually sort the array by comparing each element:\n- Start with [3, 1, 1, 8]\n- Compare 3 and 1: 1 is smaller, so swap \u2192 [1, 3, 1, 8]",
