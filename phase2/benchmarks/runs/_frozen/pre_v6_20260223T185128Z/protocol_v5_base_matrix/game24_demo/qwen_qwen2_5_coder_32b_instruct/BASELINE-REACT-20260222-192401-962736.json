    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [1, 1, 7, 4]. Since no tools are available, I need to think through this problem manually. This looks like it could be a mathematical problem or a sequence problem. Let me consider what operations or patterns might apply to these numbers.\n\nLooking at [1, 1, 7, 4], I should consider:\n- Are these consecutive terms in a sequence?\n- Can I perform operations on them to get a specific result?\n- Is there a pattern or formula that applies?\n\nSince I have no tools available, I'll need to work with basic arithmetic operations and logical reasoning about the sequence.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or relationship between these numbers.\n\nFINAL: 13\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Looking more carefully at [1, 1, 7, 4], if I add all numbers: 1 + 1"
