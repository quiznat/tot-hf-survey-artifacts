The first differences are \u22122, +3, +6. Looking at second differences: (+3)\u2212(\u22122)=5, (+6)\u2212(+3)=3. This suggests a non-standard pattern. However, if I consider that the differences themselves might follow a pattern (\u22122, +3, +6), the next difference could be +10 (adding 4 each time: \u22122, +3, +6, +10).
