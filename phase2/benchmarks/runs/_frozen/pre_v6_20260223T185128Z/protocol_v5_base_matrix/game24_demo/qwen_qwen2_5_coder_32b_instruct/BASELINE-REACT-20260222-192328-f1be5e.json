    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [5, 8, 7, 6]. Since no tools are available, I need to think through this problem manually. The most common benchmark tasks with arrays involve finding patterns, sorting, or performing mathematical operations. Looking at the numbers [5, 8, 7, 6], I notice they're not in ascending or descending order. Let me check if there's a simple pattern or if I should sort them.\n\nLet me try sorting them in ascending order first:\n- Original: [5, 8, 7, 6]\n- Sorted ascending: [5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nThis seems like a reasonable approach for a benchmark task. I'll provide the sorted array as my answer.\n\nFINAL: [5, 6, 7, 8]"
