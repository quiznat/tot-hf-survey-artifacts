Since no tools are available, I should look for mathematical patterns or operations that could be applied directly.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 1, 4, 1, 6\nI notice this could be a sequence where I need to find a pattern or perform some basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet me consider if there's a simple pattern or if I should just provide information about the list as is.\n\nThe list contains four elements: 1, 4, 1, 6\n\nFINAL: The list [1, 4, 1, 6] contains four elements with values 1, 4, 1, and 6 respectively.
