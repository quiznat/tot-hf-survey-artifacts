    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [2, 5, 3, 4]. Since no tools are available, I need to think through what this might be asking. This could be asking for various operations like finding the sum, maximum, minimum, sorting, or other mathematical operations on the array.

Let me reconsider what I can do with just the numbers provided.\n\nTHINK: Looking at the input [2, 5, 3, 4], I need to determine what operation is being asked for. Since no tools are available, I should consider basic operations that can be done mentally or by simple reasoning",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I need to carefully analyze what operation might be required with the input [2, 5, 3, 4] when no tools are available. Since I cannot use any tools, I should consider what basic operations I can perform mentally or through logical reasoning on these numbers. The most straightforward interpretation would be to find the sum, but since I can't use a sum tool, I need to think about how to compute it manually. However, I also need to consider if there's another interpretation - perhaps sorting, finding max/min, or some other operation. Given the lack of specific instructions and tools, I'll try to find the sum by adding them mentally: 2 + 5 = 7, then 7 + 3 = 10, then 10 + 4 = 14.\n\nFINAL: 14"
