    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to solve a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. The input is a list of lists, where each sub-list represents an equation with the last element being the constant term and the preceding elements being the coefficients of the variables. The given equations are:\n1. 2x - y = -3\n2. 7y = -21\n\nWe can solve this step-by-step. First, we will solve for y from the second equation, and then substitute the value of y into the first equation to find x.\n\nACTION: Solve 7y = -21 for y.\n\nTHINK: From the equation 7y = -21, we can isolate y by dividing both sides by 7.\n\nFINAL: y = -3\n\nACTION: Substitute y = -3 into the first equation 2x - y = -3 and solve for x.\n\nTHINK: Substituting y =",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'Solve'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there's no tool available for solving equations directly, I'll proceed with the calculation manually. We already found that y = -3 from the second equation (7y = -21). Now, I will substitute y = -3 into the first equation (2x - y = -3) to solve for x.\n\nTHINK: Substituting y = -3 into 2x - y = -3 gives us 2x - (-3) = -3, which simplifies to 2x + 3 = -3.\n\nTHINK: To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides, giving us 2x = -6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = -3.\n\nFINAL: x = -3, y = -3"
