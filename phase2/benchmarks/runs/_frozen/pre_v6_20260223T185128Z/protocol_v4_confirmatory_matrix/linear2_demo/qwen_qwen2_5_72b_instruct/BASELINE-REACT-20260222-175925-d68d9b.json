    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a system of linear equations. The equations can be represented as:\n1x + -3y = 0\n1x + 7y = -30\nI can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. I will use the elimination method to eliminate x first.\n\nACTION: none [1, -3, 0, 1, 7, -30]\nTHINK: I subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate x:\n(1x + 7y) - (1x - 3y) = -30 - 0\nThis simplifies to:\n10y = -30\nNow I can solve for y.\n\nACTION: none 10y = -30\nTHINK: Dividing both sides by 10 gives y = -3. Now that I have the value of y, I can substitute it back into",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'none'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It appears there was a misstep in specifying actions where none were actually needed, as we're not utilizing any external tools for this task. Let's continue solving the system of equations manually.\n\nTHINK: We have found that \\( y = -3 \\). Next, we will substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find \\( x \\). I'll use the first equation for this purpose: \\( 1x + -3y = 0 \\).\n\nTHINK: Substituting \\( y = -3 \\) into the equation \\( 1x + -3(-3) = 0 \\) gives us \\( 1x + 9 = 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( 1x = -9 \\) and thus \\( x = -9 \\).\n\nFINAL: The solution to the system of equations is \\( x = -9 \\) and \\( y = -3 \\)."
