    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of linear equations. The input is a list of equations where each equation is represented as a list of coefficients and the last element is the constant term. For the given input, we have two equations with two variables. We can solve this system using substitution or elimination methods. I will use the elimination method.\n\nThe equations are:\n1) -2x - 3y = -10\n2) x + 4y = 20\n\nI will start by making the coefficients of x in both equations equal so that I can eliminate x by adding or subtracting the equations.\n\nTo do this, I will multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficient of x in both equations equal (in absolute value) and then add the equations to eliminate x.\n\nACTION: None (performing calculations mentally)\n2 * (x + 4y) = 2 * 20\n2x",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding in my response format. Since I don't have any tools to call, I'll continue with the calculation directly in the THINK step.\n\nContinuing from the previous thought:\n\nWe have the equations:\n1) -2x - 3y = -10\n2) x + 4y = 20\n\nTo eliminate x, I will multiply the second equation by 2:\n2 * (x + 4y) = 2 * 20\nThis gives us:\n2x + 8y = 40\n\nNow I will add this new equation to the first equation to eliminate x.\n\n-2x - 3y = -10\n+ 2x + 8y = 40\n-------------------\n5y = 30\n\nNow I can solve for y:\ny = 30 / 5\ny = 6\n\nWith y",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: With y found to be 6, I will substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for x. Using the second equation for simplicity:\n\nx + 4y = 20\nx + 4(6) = 20\nx + 24 = 20\nx = 20 - 24\nx = -4\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = -4 and y = 6.\n\nFINAL: [-4, 6]"
