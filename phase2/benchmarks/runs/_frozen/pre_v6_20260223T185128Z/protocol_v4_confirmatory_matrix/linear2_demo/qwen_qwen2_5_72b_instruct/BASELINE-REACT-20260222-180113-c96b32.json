    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations in the system. The given equations are in the form [a, b, c] which represents ax + by = c. So, the given system is:\n\n1) 7x - 7y = -112\n2) 8x - 7y = -120\n\nI can use the method of elimination or substitution to solve this system of linear equations. Since the coefficient of y is the same in both equations, elimination would be straightforward.\n\nLet's subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate y.\n\n(8x - 7y) - (7x - 7y) = -120 - (-112)\n8x - 7y - 7x + 7y = -120 + 112\nx = -8\n\nNow",
