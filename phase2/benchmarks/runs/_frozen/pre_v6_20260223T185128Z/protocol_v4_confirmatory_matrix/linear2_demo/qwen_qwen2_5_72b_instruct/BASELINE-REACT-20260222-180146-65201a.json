    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given input is a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. Each sub-list in the 'equations' list represents an equation where the first two numbers are the coefficients of x and y, respectively, and the last number is the constant term. We need to solve this system to find the values of x and y.\n\nThe equations can be written as:\n-2x + 2y = -2\n9x + 7y = 137\n\nTo solve this system, I will use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, I'll start with the elimination method because it is straightforward for these equations.\n\nFirst, I will multiply the first equation by 9 and the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of x, so we can eliminate x by adding the two resulting equations.\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 9:\n-18x + 18y = -18",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Now that we have the first equation multiplied by 9, we should also multiply the second equation by 2 to prepare for eliminating the x variable. Let's proceed with that calculation.\n\nEquation 2 multiplied by 2:\n18x + 14y = 274\n\nNext, I will add the two equations together to eliminate x and solve for y.\nACTION: no-action\nSTEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Adding the two equations:\n\n(-18x + 18y) + (18x + 14y) = -18 + 274\n\nThis simplifies to:\n32y = 256\n\nNow we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 32.\nACTION: no-action\nSTEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Solving for y:\n\n32y = 256\ny = 256 / 3",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a mistake in the previous step. I meant to calculate `y = 256 / 32` instead of `y = 256 / 3`. Let me correct that.\n\nSolving for y:\n\n32y = 256\ny = 256 / 32\ny = 8\n\nNow that we have y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. I'll use the first equation for this purpose:\n\n-2x + 2y = -2\n-2x + 2(8) = -2\n-2x + 16 = -2\n-2x = -18\nx = -18 / -2\nx = 9\n\nWe have found the values of x and y.\nFINAL: [9, 8]"
