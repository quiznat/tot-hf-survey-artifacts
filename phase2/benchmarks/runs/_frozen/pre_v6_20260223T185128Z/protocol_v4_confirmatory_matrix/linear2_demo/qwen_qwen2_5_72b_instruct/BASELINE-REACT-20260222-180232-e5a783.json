    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this system of linear equations, I need to use a method like substitution or elimination. Since no tool is available, I will proceed with the elimination method manually.\n\nGiven equations:\n1) 4x - y = -33\n2) 9x - 9y = -54\n\nTo eliminate one variable, I can multiply the first equation by 9 and the second equation by -1 (or any equivalent factor that would make the coefficients of one of the variables cancel out when added together).\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 9 and the second equation by -1 to eliminate 'y'.\n\nACTION: None (performing calculation mentally)\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 9 gives us:\n36x - 9y = -297\n\nMultiplying the second equation by -1 gives us:\n-9x + 9y = 54\n\nNow, I can add these two",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the action step. Since no tools are available, all actions will be performed through reasoning and mental calculations. Continuing from where we left off:\n\nWe have the modified equations after multiplication:\n1) 36x - 9y = -297 (from multiplying the first equation by 9)\n2) -9x + 9y = 54 (from multiplying the second equation by -1)\n\nAdding these two equations together to eliminate 'y':\n(36x - 9y) + (-9x + 9y) = -297 + 54\n\nThis simplifies to:\n27x = -243\n\nNow, solving for 'x':\nx = -243 / 27\n\nLet's calculate the value of 'x'.\nTHINK: x = -9\n\nWith the value of 'x', we can substitute it",
