    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task involves solving a system of linear equations. The equations can be represented as follows based on the provided input: \n1) -2x + 3y = -14\n2) 0x - 4y = 16\n\nSince there are no available tools, I will solve this system of equations manually. The second equation is particularly simple because it does not involve x, allowing us to solve for y directly.\n\nACTION: SOLVE_EQUATION 0x - 4y = 16 for y\n\nTHINK: Solving the second equation for y gives us:\n-4y = 16\ny = 16 / (-4)\ny = -4\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find the value of x.\n\nACTION: SUBSTITUTE y = -4 into -2x + 3y = -1",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there are no tools to use, I will continue solving the equations step-by-step without invoking any actions.\n\nFrom the second equation:\n0x - 4y = 16\nWe can solve for y directly:\n-4y = 16\ny = 16 / (-4)\ny = -4\n\nNow substituting y = -4 into the first equation:\n-2x + 3(-4) = -14\n-2x - 12 = -14\n-2x = -14 + 12\n-2x = -2\nx = -2 / (-2)\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 1 and y = -4.\n\nFINAL: [1, -4]"
