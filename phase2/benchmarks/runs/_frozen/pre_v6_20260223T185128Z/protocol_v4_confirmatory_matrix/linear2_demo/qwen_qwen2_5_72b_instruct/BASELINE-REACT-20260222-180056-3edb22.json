    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task appears to be a system of linear equations problem. The input format suggests two equations in the form of [a, b, c] where 'a' and 'b' are coefficients of the variables x and y, and 'c' is the constant term. The equations can be written as:\n1) 9x + 9y = 99\n2) -7x + 5y = 19\n\nTo solve for x and y, I will use the method of substitution or elimination. Since there are no available tools, I will perform the calculations manually.\n\nFirst, I will try to eliminate one of the variables by manipulating the equations. Multiplying equation (1) by 7 and equation (2) by 9 should allow me to eliminate x when I add the equations together.\nACTION: CALCULATE 7 * (9x + 9y) - 9 * (-7",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'CALCULATE'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there are no available tools to perform calculations, I will continue with the reasoning to find the solution.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 7 gives us:\n7 * (9x + 9y) = 7 * 99\n63x + 63y = 693\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 9 gives us:\n9 * (-7x + 5y) = 9 * 19\n-63x + 45y = 171\n\nAdding these two equations will eliminate x:\n(63x + 63y) + (-63x + 45y) = 693 + 171\n63y + 45y = 864\n108y = 864\n\nNow we can solve for y:\ny = 864 / 10",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: There was a minor mistake in the calculation; it should be 864 divided by 108, not 10. Let's correct that:\n\ny = 864 / 108\ny = 8\n\nNow that we have the value for y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. I will use the first equation for simplicity:\n9x + 9y = 99\n9x + 9*8 = 99\n9x + 72 = 99\n9x = 99 - 72\n9x = 27\nx = 27 / 9\nx = 3\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = 3 and y = 8.\nFINAL: (3, 8)"
