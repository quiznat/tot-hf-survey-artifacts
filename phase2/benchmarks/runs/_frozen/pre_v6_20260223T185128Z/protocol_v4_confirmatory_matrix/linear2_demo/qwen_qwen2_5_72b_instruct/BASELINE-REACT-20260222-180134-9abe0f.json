    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of linear equations given in the form of coefficients and constants. The equations from the input can be represented as:\n-3x + 4y = 19\n-2x + 4y = 18\n\nTo solve for x and y, I can use the method of elimination or substitution. Since the coefficient of y is the same in both equations, I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y and solve for x.\n\nACTION: SUBTRACT [-3, 4, 19] [-2, 4, 18]\nTHINK: Performing the subtraction manually since there's no tool available:\n(-3x + 4y) - (-2x + 4y) = 19 - 18\nThis simplifies to:\n-3x + 2x + 4y - 4y = 1\nWhich further simpl",

Starting with the equations:\n-3x + 4y = 19\n-2x + 4y = 18\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n(-3x + 4y) - (-2x + 4y) = 19 - 18\nThis simplifies to:\n-3x + 2x + 4y - 4y = 1\nWhich further simplifies to:\n-x = 1\nTherefore, x = -1.\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. I'll use the second equation for simplicity:\n-2x + 4y = 18\n-2(-1) + 4y = 18\n2 + 4y =",
