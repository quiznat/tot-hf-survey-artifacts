    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input contains a list of equations represented in matrix form. Each inner list represents an equation where the last element is the constant term and the preceding elements are the coefficients of the variables. Since there are two equations with two variables (assuming the last element is the constant), we can solve this system of linear equations using substitution or elimination. However, since no specific method is mentioned and no tools are available, I will use the numpy library conceptually to find the solution as if it were available, but for the purpose of this exercise, I'll calculate it manually.\n\nThe equations from the input can be interpreted as:\n1) -6x - 7y = -6\n2) -8x + y = -8\n\nI will first solve one of the equations for one variable and then substitute that into the other equation to find the values of x and y.\n\nLet's solve the second equation for y:\ny = 8",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Now that we have determined y = 8 from the second equation, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for x.\n\nSubstituting y = 8 into the first equation:\n-6x - 7(8) = -6\n-6x - 56 = -6\n-6x = 50\nx = -50/6\nx = -25/3\n\nNow we have both x and y values, so the solution to the system of equations is x = -25/3 and y = 8.\nFINAL: {'x': -25/3, 'y': 8}"
