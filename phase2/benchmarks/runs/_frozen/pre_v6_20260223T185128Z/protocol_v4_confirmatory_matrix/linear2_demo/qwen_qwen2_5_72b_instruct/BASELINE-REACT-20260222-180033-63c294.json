    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: This task involves solving a system of linear equations. The given equations can be represented as:\n1) 7x - 4y = -3\n2) 0x - 2y = 16\n\nThe second equation is already simplified and can be used to directly solve for y. Once y is found, we can substitute it back into the first equation to solve for x.\n\nACTION: Solve -2y = 16 for y.\nFINAL: y = -8\n\nNow substituting y = -8 into the first equation:\n7x - 4(-8) = -3\n7x + 32 = -3\n7x = -35\nx = -5\n\nFINAL: The solution is x = -5, y = -8.",
