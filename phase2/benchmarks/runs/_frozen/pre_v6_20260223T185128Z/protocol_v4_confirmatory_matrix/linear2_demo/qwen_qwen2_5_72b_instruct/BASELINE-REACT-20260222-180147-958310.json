    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this system of linear equations, I need to use a method like substitution or elimination. The given equations are in the form of [a, b, c] which represents ax + by = c. So, the equations are -6x + 4y = -10 and -5x - 4y = -67. I will use the elimination method to find the values of x and y.\n\nACTION: None needed, proceeding with calculation.\n\nTHINK: Adding both equations will eliminate y, because the coefficients of y are 4 and -4, which are additive inverses. After finding x, I can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y.\n\n-6x + 4y = -10\n-5x - 4y = -67\n-----------------\n-11x = -77\n\nNow, I can solve for x.\n\n-11x",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It appears there was a misunderstanding in the previous step where I mentioned an action, but since we have no tools to use, all steps will be through reasoning and direct computation. Let's continue solving for x from the equation -11x = -77.\n\n-11x = -77\nTo solve for x, divide both sides by -11.\n\nx = -77 / -11\nx = 7\n\nNow that we have the value for x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. I'll use the first equation: -6x + 4y = -10.\n\nSubstituting x = 7 into the equation:\n\n-6(7) + 4y = -10\n-42 + 4y = -10\n\nNow, solve for y.\n\n4y = -10 + 42\n4",
