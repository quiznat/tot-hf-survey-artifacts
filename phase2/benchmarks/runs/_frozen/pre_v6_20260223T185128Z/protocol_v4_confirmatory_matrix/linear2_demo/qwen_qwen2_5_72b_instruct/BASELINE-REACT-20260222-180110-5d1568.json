    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of linear equations. Given the equations in matrix form, where each sublist represents an equation (the last element being the constant term and the preceding elements being the coefficients of the variables), I can solve this using substitution or elimination methods.

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since I cannot use any tools, I will continue solving the equations manually. We already determined that y = -5 from the second equation (-3y = 15). Now, I will substitute y = -5 into the first equation to find the value of x.\n\nThe first equation is -3x - y = -22. Substituting y with -5, we get:\n\n-3x - (-5) = -22\n-3x + 5 = -22\n\nNow I will solve for x.\nTHINK: To solve for x, I will isolate x on one side of the equation. Starting with -3x + 5 = -22, I subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n-3x = -22 - 5\n-3x = -27\n\nThen I divide both sides by -3 to solve for x:\n\nx = -27 / -",
