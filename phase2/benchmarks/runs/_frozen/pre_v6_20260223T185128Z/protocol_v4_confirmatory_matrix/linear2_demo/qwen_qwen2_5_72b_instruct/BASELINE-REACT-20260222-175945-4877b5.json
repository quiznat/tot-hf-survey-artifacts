    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve the system of linear equations represented by the matrix [[-9, 0, -9], [-6, -7, -48]], I need to perform row operations to bring it to a form where the solution can be easily read off, such as row echelon form or reduced row echelon form.\n\nACTION: Perform row operations to simplify the system of equations. However, since I don't have an explicit tool for this, I will mentally perform the Gaussian elimination process.\n\nTHINK: First, I will divide the first equation by -9 to get a leading 1 in the first row. The first row becomes [1, 0, 1]. The system now looks like this:\n1. 1x + 0y = 1\n2. -6x - 7y = -48\n\nNext, I will add 6 times the first equation to the second equation to eliminate x",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'Perform'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there's no tool to perform the row operations, I'll continue with the mental calculation. After dividing the first equation by -9, the system is:\n\n1. \\(1x + 0y = 1\\)\n2. \\(-6x - 7y = -48\\)\n\nNow, I will add 6 times the first equation to the second equation to eliminate \\(x\\) from the second equation. This gives:\n\n1. \\(1x + 0y = 1\\)\n2. \\(-7y = -48 + 6(1) = -48 + 6 = -42\\)\n\nSimplifying the second equation:\n\n2. \\(-7y = -42\\)\n\nNow, I will solve for \\(y\\) by dividing both sides by -7.\n\nFINAL: \\(y = 6\\), and from the first equation \\(x = 1\\"
