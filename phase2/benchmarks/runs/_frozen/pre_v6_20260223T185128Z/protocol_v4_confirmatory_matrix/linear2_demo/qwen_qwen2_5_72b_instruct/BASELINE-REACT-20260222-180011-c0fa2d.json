    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve the system of linear equations represented by the matrix [[1, -7, 44], [-4, -9, 83]]. This can be done using methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations like Gaussian elimination. Since no external tools are available, I will solve this step-by-step using basic algebra.\n\nThe equations can be written as:\n1. 1x - 7y = 44\n2. -4x - 9y = 83\n\nI will first use the first equation to express x in terms of y, and then substitute this expression into the second equation to solve for y. Once y is found, I can substitute it back into the first equation to find x.\n\nLet's start with solving the first equation for x.\nACTION: SOLVE_EQUATION 1x - 7y = 44 FOR x",
