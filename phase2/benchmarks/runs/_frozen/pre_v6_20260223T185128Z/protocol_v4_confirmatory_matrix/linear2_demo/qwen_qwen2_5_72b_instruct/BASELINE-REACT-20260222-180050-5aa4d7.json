    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a system of linear equations. The equations can be represented as:\n1) 5x - 2y = 46\n2) 9x + y = 46\n\nTo solve this system, I can use the method of substitution or elimination. I will use the elimination method to eliminate one of the variables. First, I will multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of y in both equations.\n\nThe equations will then be:\n1) 5x - 2y = 46\n2) 18x + 2y = 92\n\nAdding these two equations will eliminate y and allow me to solve for x.\nTHINK: Adding the two equations:\n(5x - 2y) + (18x + 2y) = 46 + 92\n23x = 138\nx =",
