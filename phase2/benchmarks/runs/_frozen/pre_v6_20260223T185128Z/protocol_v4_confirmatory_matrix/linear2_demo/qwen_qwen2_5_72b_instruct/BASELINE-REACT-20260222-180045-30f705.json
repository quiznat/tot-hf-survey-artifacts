    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve the system of linear equations given in matrix form. The equations can be written as:\n\n-5x + 5y = -35\n5x - 6y = 44\n\nTo solve this system, I will use the method of substitution or elimination. Since no specific method is requested, I'll proceed with the elimination method because it is straightforward for this set of equations.\n\nFirst, I will add the two equations together to eliminate x and solve for y. Then, I will substitute the value of y back into one of the original equations to find x.\nTHINK: Adding the two equations:\n\n(-5x + 5y) + (5x - 6y) = -35 + 44\n-5x + 5x + 5y - 6y = 9\n0x - 1y = 9\n-y = 9",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Solving for y:\n\n-y = 9\ny = -9\n\nNow that we have the value for y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation for this purpose:\n\n-5x + 5y = -35\n-5x + 5(-9) = -35\n-5x - 45 = -35\n-5x = 10\nx = -2\n\nThe solution to the system of equations is x = -2, y = -9.\nFINAL: (-2, -9)"
