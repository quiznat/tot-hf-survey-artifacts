    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a system of linear equations. Given the equations in matrix form as [[0, -9, 72], [-2, 1, -12]], I can interpret this as two equations with two variables. Let's denote the variables as x and y. The equations can be written as:\n\n1) 0x - 9y = 72\n2) -2x + 1y = -12\n\nI will first simplify these equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nACTION: None (Solving the equations directly)\n\nTHINK: Starting with the first equation, we have -9y = 72. We can solve for y by dividing both sides by -9.\n\n-9y / -9 = 72 / -9\ny = -8\n\nNow that we have y, we can substitute its value into the second equation to solve for x",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the format of my response. Since no tools are available, I'll continue to solve the system of equations directly.\n\nGiven the system:\n1) 0x - 9y = 72\n2) -2x + 1y = -12\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for y:\n-9y = 72\ny = 72 / -9\ny = -8\n\nNow we substitute y = -8 into the second equation to solve for x:\n-2x + (-8) = -12\n-2x - 8 = -12\n-2x = -12 + 8\n-2x = -4\nx = -4 / -2\nx = 2\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = 2 and y = -8.\n\nFINAL: x ="
