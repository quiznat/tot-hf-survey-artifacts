    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a system of linear equations. The given equations can be represented as:\n1) -7x - 4y = -31\n2) -2x - 2y = -14\n\nTo solve this system, I will use the method of elimination or substitution. First, I'll simplify the second equation to make it easier to eliminate one of the variables.\n\nACTION: Simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by -2.\n-2x / -2 - 2y / -2 = -14 / -2\n\nTHINK: After simplifying, the second equation becomes:\nx + y = 7\n\nNow that we have simplified the second equation, I will proceed with the elimination method to solve for x and y.\n\nACTION: Subtract the simplified second equation from the first equation to eliminate y.\n(-7x - 4y) - (x + y) =",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there's no tool available to perform algebraic operations directly, I'll continue reasoning through the problem step-by-step without invoking any tools.\n\nThe simplified second equation is:\nx + y = 7\n\nWe can rearrange this to express y in terms of x:\ny = 7 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the first equation to solve for x:\n-7x - 4(7 - x) = -31\n\nACTION: Substitute y = 7 - x into the first equation and solve for x.\n-7x - 4(7 - x) = -31\n-7x - 28 + 4x = -31\n-3x - 28 = -31\n-3x = -3\nx = 1\n\nTHINK: Now that we have solved for x, we can substitute x back into the equation y =",
