    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task appears to be solving a system of linear equations. The given equations can be represented as:\n1) -7x + 8y = -70\n2) 8x + 2y = 2\n\nTo solve this system, I will use the method of substitution or elimination. Given that we don't have any tools available, I will proceed with the elimination method, which involves manipulating the equations to eliminate one of the variables.\n\nFirst, I need to make the coefficients of one of the variables (either x or y) the same in both equations so they can be added or subtracted to eliminate one variable.\n\nI'll start by making the coefficients of y the same in both equations. Multiplying the second equation by 4 will do this:\n\n1) -7x + 8y = -70\n2') 32x + 8y = 8\n\nNow I can subtract equation",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's correct the process and continue from where it was left off. We have the equations as follows after multiplying the second equation by 4:\n\n1) -7x + 8y = -70\n2') 32x + 8y = 8\n\nNow, I will subtract equation 1) from equation 2') to eliminate the y variable:\n\n2') - 1)\n(32x + 8y) - (-7x + 8y) = 8 - (-70)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n32x + 8y + 7x - 8y = 8 + 70\n39x = 78\n\nNow I can solve for x.\nACTION: calculate x = 78 / 39\nSTEP 2 MODEL: THINK: After calculating, we should have the value for x. Let's find out what it",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Since there is no calculation tool available, I will perform the calculation manually. We have:\n\n39x = 78\n\nDividing both sides by 39 gives:\n\nx = 78 / 39\n\nSimplifying this fraction will give us the value of x.\n\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. I will use the second equation for this purpose:\n\n8x + 2y = 2\n\nSubstituting x = 2 into this equation:\n\n8(2) + 2y = 2\n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of y.\nTHINK: Simplifying the equation:\n\n16 + 2y = 2\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides:\n\n2y = 2 - 16\n2y = -14",
