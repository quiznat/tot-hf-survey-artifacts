    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to solve a system of linear equations. The equations can be represented as:\n1) 6x - y = -25\n2) -4x + 6y = 22\n\nTo solve these equations, I will use the method of substitution or elimination. Since there are no specific tools provided, I will perform the calculations directly.\n\nFirst, let's solve equation 1 for y in terms of x.\n6x - y = -25\ny = 6x + 25\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into equation 2 and solve for x.\n-4x + 6(6x + 25) = 22\n\nLet me calculate the value of x.\nACTION: None -4x + 36x + 150 = 22\n\nTHINK: Simplify the equation to find x.\n32x +",

Let's correct that and proceed with solving the equation for x manually:\n\nFrom the equation:\n-4x + 36x + 150 = 22\n\nCombine like terms:\n32x + 150 = 22\n\nSubtract 150 from both sides:\n32x = 22 - 150\n32x = -128\n\nDivide by 32:\nx = -128 / 32\nx = -4\n\nNow that we have the value of x, let's substitute it back into the equation for y:\ny = 6(-4) + 25\ny = -24 + 25\ny = 1\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = -4 and y = 1.\nFINAL:",
