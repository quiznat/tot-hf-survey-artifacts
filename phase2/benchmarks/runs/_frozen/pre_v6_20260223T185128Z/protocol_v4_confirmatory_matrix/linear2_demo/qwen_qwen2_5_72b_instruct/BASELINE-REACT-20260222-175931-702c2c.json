    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this system of linear equations, I need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The equations given can be written as:\n1) -7x + 8y = -25\n2) -7x - 7y = -70\n\nI will use the method of elimination or substitution to solve for x and y. Since there are no tools available, I will perform the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that both equations have -7x, which makes it easy to eliminate x by subtracting the second equation from the first.\n\nACTION: CALCULATE -7x + 8y - (-7x - 7y) = -25 - (-70)\nTHINK: By performing the subtraction, I get:\n15y = 45\n\nNow, I will solve for y.\n\nACTION: CALCULATE y = 45 / 15",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'CALCULATE'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding in specifying actions. Since I don't have access to any tools, I will continue with the calculation directly here.\n\nFrom the previous step, we have:\n15y = 45\n\nSolving for y gives:\ny = 45 / 15\ny = 3\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. I'll use the first equation for this purpose:\n-7x + 8(3) = -25\n\nACTION: SUBSTITUTE y = 3 INTO -7x + 8y = -25\nTHINK: Substituting y = 3 into the equation:\n-7x + 8(3) = -25\n-7x + 24 = -25\n\nNow, I will solve for x.\n\nACTION: CALCULATE -7",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'SUBSTITUTE'",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Since I cannot use the action format for calculations and substitutions, I will proceed with the necessary steps directly in my thoughts.\n\nContinuing from where we left off:\n-7x + 24 = -25\n\nSubtract 24 from both sides to isolate the term with x:\n-7x = -25 - 24\n-7x = -49\n\nNow, divide both sides by -7 to solve for x:\nx = -49 / -7\nx = 7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 7 and y = 3.\n\nFINAL: (x = 7, y = 3)"
