    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to solve the system of linear equations represented by the coefficients and constants: \\[-9x + 3y = -39\\] \\[-6x - 9y = 18\\]. To solve this, I will use the method of elimination or substitution. Since there are no available tools, I'll proceed with manual calculation.\n\nFirst, let's simplify each equation if possible. In this case, we can divide the first equation by -3 and the second equation by -3 to make the coefficients easier to work with.\n\nSimplified equations:\n\\[3x - y = 13\\]\n\\[2x + 3y = -6\\]\n\nNext, I will use the method of elimination to eliminate one of the variables. I can multiply the first equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \\(y\\) in both equations for elimination.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 3:\n\\[",

After multiplying the first equation by 3, we have:\n\n\\[9x - 3y = 39\\]\n\\[2x + 3y = -6\\]\n\nNow, adding these two equations will eliminate the \\(y\\) variable, allowing us to solve for \\(x\\).\n\nACTION: no-action\nTHINK: Adding the equations:\n\\[9x - 3y + 2x + 3y = 39 - 6\\]\n\\[11x = 33\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[x = \\frac{33}{11} = 3\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(x = 3\\), we can substitute this value back into one of the original simplified equations to solve for \\(y\\). Let's use the first simplified equation:\n\\[3x",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was an error due to the incorrect use of \"no-action.\" Let me continue the solution directly without referencing any action.\n\nContinuing from the step where we found \\(x = 3\\):\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 3\\) into the first simplified equation:\n\\[3(3) - y = 13\\]\n\\[9 - y = 13\\]\n\nSolving for \\(y\\):\n\\[-y = 13 - 9\\]\n\\[-y = 4\\]\n\\[y = -4\\]\n\nThus, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\\[x = 3, y = -4\\]\n\nFINAL: (3, -4)"
