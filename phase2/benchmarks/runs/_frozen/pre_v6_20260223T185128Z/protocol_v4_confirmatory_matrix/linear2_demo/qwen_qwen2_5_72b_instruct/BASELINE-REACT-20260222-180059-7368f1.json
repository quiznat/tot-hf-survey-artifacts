    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve the system of linear equations given in the task input, we need to apply a method such as substitution or elimination. The equations provided are in the form [a, b, c] which can be interpreted as ax + by = c. Let's rewrite the equations for clarity and then proceed to solve them.\n\nThe equations are:\n1) -8x - 2y = -60\n2) -1x - 2y = -4\n\nWe can start by using the elimination method to eliminate one of the variables. Since both equations have the term -2y, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y and solve for x.\n\nACTION: Eliminate y by subtracting the second equation from the first.\n-8x - 2y - (-1x - 2y) = -60 - (-4)\n-8x - 2y + 1x +",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'Eliminate'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems I cannot use an action to directly manipulate the equations since there are no available tools. I will continue solving the equations manually.\n\nContinuing from:\n-8x - 2y = -60\n-1x - 2y = -4\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n(-8x - 2y) - (-1x - 2y) = -60 - (-4)\n-8x - 2y + 1x + 2y = -60 + 4\n-7x = -56\n\nNow, solve for x:\nx = -56 / -7\nx = 8\n\nWith x known, substitute x back into one of the original equations to solve for y. I'll use the second equation for simplicity:\n-1x - 2y = -4\n-1(8) - 2y = -4",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the calculation:\n\n-1(8) - 2y = -4\n-8 - 2y = -4\n\nAdd 8 to both sides to isolate the term with y:\n-2y = -4 + 8\n-2y = 4\n\nNow, solve for y:\ny = 4 / -2\ny = -2\n\nWe have found the values of x and y. Let's verify these solutions by substituting them back into the original equations.\n-8x - 2y = -60\n-8(8) - 2(-2) = -64 + 4 = -60\n\n-1x - 2y = -4\n-1(8) - 2(-2) = -8 + 4 = -4\n\nBoth equations are satisfied with x = 8 and y = -2.\n\nFINAL: [8, -"
