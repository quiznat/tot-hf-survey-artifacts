    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this benchmark task, I need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The given system of linear equations is:\n\n0x + 6y = -54\n6x + 2y = 18\n\nI can start by simplifying the first equation to express y in terms of x, or vice versa. However, since there's no x term in the first equation, it's already simplified for y.\n\nACTION: Simplify the first equation to express y.\n0x + 6y = -54\n6y = -54\ny = -54 / 6\ny = -9\n\nNow that we have y = -9, we can substitute this value into the second equation to find x.\n\nACTION: Substitute y = -9 into the second equation and solve for x.\n6x + 2(-9) = 18\n6x -",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'Simplify'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It appears there was an attempt to use a tool that doesn't exist in the current environment. Since no tools are available, I'll proceed with solving the equations step-by-step manually.\n\nGiven the equations:\n0x + 6y = -54\n6x + 2y = 18\n\nFrom the first equation, we can directly solve for y:\n6y = -54\ny = -54 / 6\ny = -9\n\nNow, substituting y = -9 into the second equation to solve for x:\n6x + 2(-9) = 18\n6x - 18 = 18\n6x = 36\nx = 36 / 6\nx = 6\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 6 and y = -9.\nFINAL: {'x': 6, 'y':"
