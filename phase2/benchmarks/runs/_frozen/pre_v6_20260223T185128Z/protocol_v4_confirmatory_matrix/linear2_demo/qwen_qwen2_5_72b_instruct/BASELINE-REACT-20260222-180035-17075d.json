    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task requires solving a system of linear equations. Given the input, we have two equations with two variables that can be represented as follows:\n1) 8x + 7y = 97\n2) -5x - 4y = -58\n\nTo solve this, I will use the method of elimination or substitution to find the values of x and y.\n\nTHINK: First, I will multiply the equations so that one of the variable coefficients match in absolute value but differ in sign to eliminate one of the variables.\n\nTHINK: Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 8 to eliminate the x variable:\n1) 5 * (8x + 7y) = 5 * 97\n2) 8 * (-5x - 4y) = 8 * (-58)\n\nACTION: CALCULATE 5 * (8x + 7y",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there's no available tool for calculation, I will perform the required calculations manually.\n\nTHINK: Multiplying the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 8 gives us:\n1) 40x + 35y = 485\n2) -40x - 32y = -464\n\nTHINK: Now I will add these two equations together to eliminate the x variable and solve for y.\n\nTHINK: Adding the equations results in:\n(40x - 40x) + (35y - 32y) = 485 - 464\n3y = 21\n\nTHINK: Dividing both sides by 3 will give us the value of y.\ny = 21 / 3\n\nTHINK: After finding y, I will substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: After finding y, I will substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation for this purpose:\n8x + 7(7) = 97\n\nTHINK: Simplifying the equation:\n8x + 49 = 97\n\nTHINK: Subtract 49 from both sides to isolate the term with x:\n8x = 48\n\nTHINK: Divide both sides by 8 to solve for x:\nx = 48 / 8\n\nFINAL: x = 6, y = 7"
