    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this system of linear equations, I need to apply methods for solving simultaneous equations. Since no external tools are available, I'll use the substitution or elimination method manually. The given equations can be written as follows:\n1) 7x - 6y = 7\n2) 5x - 9y = 38\n\nI will use the elimination method to solve these equations.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: First, I need to eliminate one of the variables. To do this, I will make the coefficients of y in both equations equal by finding a common multiple. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18. I will multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to achieve this.\n\nTHINK: After multiplying, the equations become:\n1) 21x - 18y = 21 (multiplied by 3)\n2",

Let's proceed with solving the equations directly.\n\nTHINK: After multiplying, the equations become:\n1) 21x - 18y = 21 (multiplied by 3)\n2) 10x - 18y = 76 (multiplied by 2)\n\nNext, I will subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y.\n\nTHINK: Subtracting the second equation from the first:\n(21x - 18y) - (10x - 18y) = 21 - 76\n21x - 10x = -55\n11x = -55\nx = -5\n\nTHINK: Now that I have the value of x, I can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y.",
