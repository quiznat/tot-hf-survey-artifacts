    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this benchmark task, I need to find the solution to the system of linear equations represented by the matrix [[0, 2, -18], [-2, -9, 89]]. Each row in the matrix represents an equation in the form ax + by = c. Let's write out the equations explicitly.\n\nThe given matrix translates to the following system of equations:\n1. 0x + 2y = -18\n2. -2x - 9y = 89\n\nI will start by simplifying the first equation to express y in terms of x, and then use substitution or elimination to solve for x and y.\n\nACTION: Simplify the first equation to express y in terms of x.\nTHINK: The first equation is 0x + 2y = -18. Since there is no x term, we can directly solve for y.\n\n2y = -1",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding; there are no tools available to use, so I'll proceed with solving the equations manually. Let's correct the simplification step. From the first equation, 0x + 2y = -18, we can solve for y:\n\n2y = -18\ny = -18 / 2\ny = -9\n\nNow that we have y, we can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for x.\n\nACTION: Substitute y = -9 into the second equation -2x - 9y = 89 and solve for x.\nTHINK: Substituting y = -9 into the second equation:\n\n-2x - 9(-9) = 89\n-2x + 81 = 89\n-2x = 89 - 81\n-2x = 8\nx = 8 /",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'Substitute'",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Since there are no tools available, I will continue the calculation directly within the reasoning steps. We had -2x = 8, from which we can solve for x.\n\nx = 8 / (-2)\nx = -4\n\nWe have now found the values of both variables:\nx = -4\ny = -9\n\nThese are the solutions to the system of equations.\n\nFINAL: The solution to the system of equations is x = -4 and y = -9."
