    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of linear equations. The given equations can be represented as:\n1) 2x + 2y = -20\n2) -x + 3y = -18\n\nWe can solve this system using methods such as substitution or elimination. Since there are no tools available, I will perform the calculations step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I will multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of x in both equations for elimination.\n\nACTION: None needed, proceeding with calculation.\n\nTHINK: Multiplying the second equation by 2 gives us:\n2) -2x + 6y = -36\n\nNow, adding the two equations together to eliminate x:\n\n(2x + 2y) + (-2x + 6y) = -20 + (-36)\n2y + 6y = -56\n8y = -56",

I will use the first equation for this purpose.\n\nTHINK: Substituting y = -7 into the first equation:\n2x + 2(-7) = -20\n2x - 14 =",
