    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve the system of linear equations represented by the given inputs. The equations can be written as follows based on the input list:\n1) 9x + 2y = 62\n2) -8x - 2y = -56\n\nI will use the method of elimination or substitution to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. First, I'll try to eliminate one of the variables.\n\nACTION: None (Calculating manually)\n\nTHINK: To eliminate y, I can add both equations together since the coefficients of y in each equation are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\n\n(9x + 2y) + (-8x - 2y) = 62 + (-56)\nThis simplifies to:\n9x - 8x + 2y - 2y = 62 - 56\nWhich further simplifies to:",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was an error due to the incorrect format for the action step. Since no tools are available, all steps should be part of the THINK process. Let me continue with solving the equations.\n\nTo eliminate y, I can add both equations together as previously mentioned:\n(9x + 2y) + (-8x - 2y) = 62 + (-56)\nThis simplifies to:\n9x - 8x + 2y - 2y = 62 - 56\nWhich further simplifies to:\nx = 6\n\nNow that I have the value of x, I can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for y. I will use the first equation for this purpose.\n\nACTION: None (Substituting the value of x into the first equation)\n\nTHINK: Substituting x = 6 into the first equation:\n9(6)",
