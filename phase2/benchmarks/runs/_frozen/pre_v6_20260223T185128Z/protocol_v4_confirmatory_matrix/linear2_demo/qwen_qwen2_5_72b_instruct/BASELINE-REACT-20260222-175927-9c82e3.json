    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve the system of linear equations represented by the given input. The equations can be written as:\n\n1) 7x - 9y = -72\n2) -9x + 0y = 81\n\nSince there's no y term in the second equation, we can directly solve for x from the second equation and then substitute the value of x into the first equation to find y.\n\nACTION: None required, proceeding to solve the equations.\n\nTHINK: From the second equation (-9x = 81), we can solve for x.\n\nx = 81 / -9\nx = -9\n\nNow that we have x, we will substitute it into the first equation to solve for y.\n\n7(-9) - 9y = -72\n-63 - 9y = -72\n-9y = -72 + 63",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was an error because I tried to indicate that no action with a tool is necessary. I'll proceed to solve the problem without referencing actions, as there are no tools available.\n\nFrom the second equation (-9x = 81), we can solve for x.\n\nx = 81 / -9\nx = -9\n\nNow that we have x, we will substitute it into the first equation to solve for y.\n\n7(-9) - 9y = -72\n-63 - 9y = -72\n-9y = -72 + 63\n-9y = -9\n\nDividing both sides by -9 gives us y.\n\ny = -9 / -9\ny = 1\n\nThe solution to the system of equations is x = -9 and y = 1.\n\nFINAL: {'solution': {'x': -9, 'y':"
