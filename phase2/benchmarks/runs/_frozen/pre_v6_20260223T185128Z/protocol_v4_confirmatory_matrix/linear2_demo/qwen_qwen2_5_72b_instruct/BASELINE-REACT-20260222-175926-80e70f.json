    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a system of linear equations, which can be represented as:\n-1x - 8y = 29\n4x - 7y = 1\n\nTo solve this system, I can use the method of substitution or elimination. Since there are no available tools, I will perform the calculations manually.\n\nFirst, I will multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 1 to align the coefficients of x in both equations:\n\n(-1x * 4) - (8y * 4) = 29 * 4\n(4x * 1) - (7y * 1) = 1 * 1\n\nThis simplifies to:\n-4x - 32y = 116\n4x - 7y = 1\n\nNext, I will add these two equations together to eliminate x and solve for y.\nACTION:",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Adding the two equations together:\n\n(-4x + 4x) + (-32y - 7y) = 116 + 1\n0x - 39y = 117\n\nSolving for y:\n-39y = 117\ny = 117 / -39\ny = -3\n\nNow that I have the value of y, I can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. I'll use the first equation for this purpose:\n\n-1x - 8(-3) = 29\n-1x + 24 = 29\n-1x = 29 - 24\n-1x = 5\nx = -5\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = -5 and y = -3.\nFINAL: x = -5, y"
