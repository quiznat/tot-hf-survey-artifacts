    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of linear equations in matrix form. Each equation is represented as a list where the first two elements are the coefficients of x and y, and the last element is the constant term. To solve these equations, I will use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, I can start by representing the equations clearly:\n\nEquation 1: -7x + y = -7\nEquation 2: 6x + 7y = 6\n\nI will now proceed to solve these equations using the elimination method, which involves adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable.\n\nTHINK: To eliminate one of the variables, I should make the coefficients of either x or y the same (or negatives of each other) in both equations. Multiplying Equation 1 by 7 and Equation 2 by 1 will allow me to eliminate y when I add the equations together.\n\nEquation",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing from the previous step, after multiplying the equations, we have:\n\nEquation 1 (multiplied by 7): -49x + 7y = -49\nEquation 2: 6x + 7y = 6\n\nNow, I will add these two equations to eliminate y and solve for x.\nSTEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Adding the modified equations:\n\n-49x + 7y = -49\n 6x + 7y = 6\n-----------------\n-43x + 14y = -43\n\nHowever, there was a mistake in the addition; it should be:\n\n-49x + 7y = -49\n 6x + 7y = 6\n-----------------\n-43x + 0y = -43\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n-43x = -",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Correcting the simplification:\n\n-43x = -43\n\nDividing both sides by -43 gives us:\n\nx = 1\n\nWith x found, I will substitute x = 1 back into one of the original equations to solve for y. I'll use Equation 1 for this purpose.\nACTION: no-action\nTHINK: Substituting x = 1 into Equation 1:\n\n-7(1) + y = -7\n-7 + y = -7\n\nAdding 7 to both sides of the equation:\n\ny = 0\n\nThus, the solution to the system of equations is x = 1 and y = 0.\nFINAL: [1, 0]"
