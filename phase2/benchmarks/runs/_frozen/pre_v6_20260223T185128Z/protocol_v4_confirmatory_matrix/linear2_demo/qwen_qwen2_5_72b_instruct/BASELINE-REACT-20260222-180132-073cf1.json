    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of linear equations represented as a list of lists, where each inner list represents an equation in the form [a, b, c] for the equation ax + by = c. Given the equations 5x - y = 31 and 3x + 4y = 14, I will solve this system using substitution or elimination method. Let's start with the elimination method.\n\nACTION: Eliminate one variable to solve for the other. To do this, I will first make the coefficients of y in both equations the same by multiplying the equations appropriately, then subtract one from the other to eliminate y.\n\nTHINK: Multiply the first equation by 4 (to get -4y) and the second equation by 1 (it already has 4y). This gives us:\n- First equation: 20x - 4y = 124\n- Second equation:",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'Eliminate'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there are no tools available to perform the elimination directly, I will manually calculate the steps involved in the elimination method.\n\nTHINK: We have the equations:\n1) 5x - y = 31\n2) 3x + 4y = 14\n\nTo eliminate y, we can multiply the first equation by 4 so that when we add it to the second equation, the y terms will cancel out. Multiplying the first equation by 4 gives us:\n4 * (5x - y) = 4 * 31\nWhich simplifies to:\n20x - 4y = 124\n\nNow, we add this to the second equation (3x + 4y = 14):\n20x - 4y + 3x + 4y = 124 + 14\nCombining like terms, we get:\n2",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Continuing from the previous step, combining like terms gives us:\n20x + 3x = 124 + 14\n23x = 138\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 23:\nx = 138 / 23\nx = 6\n\nWith x = 6, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for y. Using the first equation:\n5x - y = 31\n5(6) - y = 31\n30 - y = 31\n-y = 31 - 30\n-y = 1\ny = -1\n\nSo the solution is x = 6 and y = -1.\n\nFINAL: (6, -1)"
