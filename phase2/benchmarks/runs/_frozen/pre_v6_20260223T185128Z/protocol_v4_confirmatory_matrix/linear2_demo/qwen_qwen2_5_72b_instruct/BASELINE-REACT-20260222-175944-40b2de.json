    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. The given equations can be written as follows based on the provided input:\n- -2x + 5y = 2\n- 9x + y = 85\n\nTo solve this system, I will use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's start by isolating one of the variables from one of the equations.\n\nACTION: Solve -2x + 5y = 2 for y.\nTHINK: Solving -2x + 5y = 2 for y gives us:\n5y = 2 + 2x\ny = (2 + 2x) / 5\n\nNow that we have an expression for y, we can substitute it into the second equation to solve for x.\n\nACTION: Substitute y = (2 + 2x) / 5 into 9x + y = 85 and",
