    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this system of linear equations, I need to determine the values of x and y that satisfy both equations simultaneously. The equations provided can be represented as:\n1) -6x - 5y = -19\n2) 5x - 2y = 59\n\nI will use the method of substitution or elimination to find the solution. Here, elimination seems straightforward because we can easily manipulate the equations to eliminate one variable.\n\nACTION: Eliminate one variable by manipulating and combining the equations.\n\nTHINK: To eliminate y, I can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 5 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. This will allow me to add the equations together to eliminate y.\n\nACTION: Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 5.\n\nTHINK: After multiplying, the equations become:\n1) -12",

Let's proceed with the calculation steps here instead.\n\nTHINK: To eliminate y, I'll multiply the first equation by 2 and the second by 5, so the coefficients of y are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\n\nThe equations after multiplication are:\n1) -12x - 10y = -38 (multiplying the first equation by 2)\n2) 25x - 10y = 295 (multiplying the second equation by 5)\n\nNext, I will add these two equations to eliminate y.\n\nACTION: Add the two modified equations together.\nTHINK: Adding the two modified equations (-12x - 10y = -38) and (25x - 10y = 295) results in:\n\n(25x -",

I'll use the second equation for this purpose: 5x - 2y = 59.\n\nSubstituting x = 19.77 into the equation:\n5(19.77) - 2y = 59\n98.85 - 2y = 59\n\nSolving for y involves isolating it on one side of the equation:\n-2y = 59 - 98.85\n-2y = -39.85\ny = -39.85 / -2\ny = 19.925\n\nSo, the solutions to the system of equations are approximately x = 19.77 and y = 19.925.\n\nFINAL: The solution"
