    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to solve a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. The system can be written as:\n\n8x + 8y = -16\n-5x + 8y = 62\n\nTo solve this system, I will use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, I'll use the elimination method for simplicity.\n\nFirst, I'll manipulate the equations to eliminate one of the variables. I can do this by making the coefficients of y in both equations equal and then subtracting one equation from the other.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 8 and the second equation by -8 (to make the y coefficients opposite in sign) gives:\n\n(8 * 8)x + (8 * 8)y = 8 * -16\n(-8 * -5)x + (-8 * 8)y = -8 * 62\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n64x +",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's correct and complete the calculation steps. We need to multiply the equations so that the coefficients of y become opposites. However, we don't actually need to change them since they already have different signs and are the same in absolute value. So, let's just add the two equations to eliminate y.\n\nAdding the two original equations:\n\n8x + 8y = -16\n-5x + 8y = 62\n-----------------\n(8x + (-5x)) + (8y + 8y) = -16 + 62\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3x + 16y = 46\n\nBut we want to eliminate y, not create a new equation with it. We should subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y:\n\n8x + 8y - (-5x + 8y) = -16 - 62\n\nThis",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Continuing from the last step, we will perform the subtraction correctly to eliminate y:\n\n8x + 8y - (-5x + 8y) = -16 - 62\n8x + 8y + 5x - 8y = -78\n(8x + 5x) + (8y - 8y) = -78\n13x = -78\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n13x / 13 = -78 / 13\nx = -6\n\nWith x known, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. I will use the first equation:\n\n8x + 8y = -16\n8(-6) + 8y = -16\n-48 + 8y = -16\n\nNow we solve for y",
    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: To find y, we continue from the equation:\n\n-48 + 8y = -16\n\nWe will isolate y by adding 48 to both sides and then dividing by 8:\n\n8y = -16 + 48\n8y = 32\ny = 32 / 8\ny = 4\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is x = -6 and y = 4.\n\nFINAL: {'x': -6, 'y': 4}"
