    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task appears to be solving a system of linear equations. The given equations in matrix form can be written as:\n1) 5x + 7y = -12\n2) -3x - y = -12\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Since there are no tools available, I will proceed with the elimination method manually.\n\nFirst, I will manipulate the equations to eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate y by making the coefficients of y in both equations equal.\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 7 gives:\n-21x - 7y = -84\n\nNow we have:\n1) 5x + 7y = -12\n2) -21x - 7y = -84\n\nAdding these two equations will eliminate y and allow us to solve for x.\nACTION: ADD [5, 7,",

I'll use the first equation for this purpose.\nACTION: SUBSTITUTE 6 INTO [5, 7,",
