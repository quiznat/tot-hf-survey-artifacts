    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve solving a system of linear equations. Given the input, we have two equations with two variables. I can represent these as:\n\n1) 5x + y = 45\n2) -9x - 7y = -107\n\nTo solve for x and y, I will use substitution or elimination method. Let's start by expressing y in terms of x from the first equation and then substitute it into the second equation.\n\nFrom the first equation:\ny = 45 - 5x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the second equation.\n\nTHINK: Substituting the expression for y (y = 45 - 5x) into the second equation (-9x - 7(45 - 5x) = -107), I can solve for x.\n\n-9x - 7(45 - 5x) = -",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing from where we left off:\n\n-9x - 7(45 - 5x) = -107\n\nDistribute the -7 across the parentheses:\n\n-9x - 315 + 35x = -107\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n26x - 315 = -107\n\nAdd 315 to both sides:\n\n26x = 208\n\nDivide both sides by 26:\n\nx = 8\n\nWith x found, I can now substitute x back into the first equation to find y.\n\ny = 45 - 5x\n\nSubstitute x = 8:\n\ny = 45 - 5(8)\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = 45 - 40\n\ny = 5\n\nSo, the solution is x = 8, y = 5.\nFINAL: [8,"
