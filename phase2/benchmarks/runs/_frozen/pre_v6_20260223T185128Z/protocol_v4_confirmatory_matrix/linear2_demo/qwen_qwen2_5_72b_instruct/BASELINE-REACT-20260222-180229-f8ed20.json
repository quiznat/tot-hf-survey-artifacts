    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of equations in the form of [[a, b, c], [d, e, f]], which represents the system of linear equations:\n-1x + 2y = 4\n-6x + 7y = 29\n\nTo solve this system of equations, I can use the method of substitution or elimination. Since there are no tools available, I will perform the calculations manually.\n\nLet's use the elimination method. First, I will multiply the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\n\nEquation 1: -6x + 12y = 24\nEquation 2: -6x + 7y = 29\n\nNow, I will subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x and solve for y.\nTHINK: Subtract",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: After performing the subtraction, we get:\n\n(12y - 7y) = (24 - 29)\n5y = -5\ny = -1\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation for simplicity:\n-1x + 2(-1) = 4\n-1x - 2 = 4\n-1x = 6\nx = -6\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = -6 and y = -1.\nFINAL: (-6, -1)"
