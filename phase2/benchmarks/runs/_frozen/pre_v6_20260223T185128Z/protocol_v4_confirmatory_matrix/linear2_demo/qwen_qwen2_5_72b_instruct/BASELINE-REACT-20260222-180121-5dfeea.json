    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a system of linear equations. The equations given can be represented as follows:\n1) 9x - 8y = -68\n2) x + y = 0\nWe can use substitution or elimination method to solve this system. Let's use the substitution method since the second equation is already in a simple form where we can easily express x in terms of y.\n\nACTION: SUBSTITUTE x = -y FROM EQUATION 2 INTO EQUATION 1\n9(-y) - 8y = -68\n\nTHINK: Simplify the substituted equation to solve for y.\n-9y - 8y = -68\n-17y = -68\n\nACTION: SOLVE FOR y\ny = -68 / -17\n\nTHINK: Now that we have the value of y, let's calculate it.\ny = 4\n\nACTION",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'SUBSTITUTE'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was an attempt to use a tool that does not exist within our available options. Since no tools are available, I will continue with the calculation manually. We have simplified the equation and found that \\( y = 4 \\). Now, we need to substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find \\( x \\).\n\nACTION: SUBSTITUTE y = 4 INTO x + y = 0\nx + 4 = 0\n\nTHINK: Solve for x.\nx = -4\n\nFINAL: The solution to the system of equations is x = -4, y = 4."
