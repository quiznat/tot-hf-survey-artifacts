    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task requires solving a system of linear equations. Given the equations in the form [a, b, c] where ax + by = c, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations simultaneously. The equations provided are 3x + 2y = 17 and 9x - 7y = 116. I will use the substitution or elimination method to solve these equations.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: To solve the system of equations, I will use the elimination method. First, I will multiply the first equation by 3 to align the coefficients of x in both equations.\n\nTHINK: Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives us: 9x + 6y = 51. Now we have the equations:\n1. 9x + 6y = 51\n2. 9x - 7y = 11",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: There was an error because I attempted to use a tool that is not available. Since no tools are available, I will proceed with the calculations manually.\n\nTHINK: We now subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate x:\n(9x + 6y) - (9x - 7y) = 51 - 116\nThis simplifies to:\n13y = -65\n\nTHINK: Solving for y, we get:\ny = -65 / 13\ny = -5\n\nTHINK: Now, substitute y = -5 into one of the original equations to solve for x. I will use the first equation:\n3x + 2(-5) = 17\n3x - 10 = 17\n3x = 27\nx = 27 / 3\nx = 9\n\nFINAL: The solution"
