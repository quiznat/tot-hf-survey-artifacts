    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of linear equations. The equations are:\n-2x + 5y = 2\n9x + 1y = 85\n\nI'll use the substitution or elimination method to solve this system. Let me use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, I'll multiply the first equation by 9 and the second equation by 2 to eliminate x:\n-18x + 45y = 18\n18x + 2y = 170\n\nAdding these equations:\n47y = 188\ny = 4\n\nNow I'll substitute y = 4 back into the first original equation:\n-2x + 5(4) = 2\n-2x + 20 = 2\n-2x = -18\nx = 9\n\nLet me verify with the second equation:\n9(9) +",
