    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and solve them. The input shows two equations with three coefficients each, which likely represent linear equations in the form ax + by = c.\n\nLooking at the equations:\n- First equation: [7, -4, -3] represents 7x - 4y = -3\n- Second equation: [0, -2, 16] represents 0x - 2y = 16, or simply -2y = 16\n\nI can solve this system of equations. From the second equation, I can immediately find y, then substitute back to find x.\n\nLet me solve the second equation first:\n-2y = 16\ny = -8\n\nNow substituting y = -8 into the first equation:\n7x - 4(-8) = -3\n7x + 32 = -3\n7x = -35",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I need to continue solving the system of equations. I've found that y = -8 from the second equation. Now I need to complete the calculation for x and provide the final answer.\n\nFrom the first equation: 7x + 32 = -3\n7x = -3 - 32\n7x = -35\nx = -5\n\nSo the solution is x = -5, y = -8.\n\nLet me verify this solution:\nFirst equation: 7(-5) - 4(-8) = -35 + 32 = -3 \u2713\nSecond equation: 0(-5) - 2(-8) = 0 + 16 = 16 \u2713\n\nThe solution is correct.\n\nFINAL: x = -5, y = -8"
