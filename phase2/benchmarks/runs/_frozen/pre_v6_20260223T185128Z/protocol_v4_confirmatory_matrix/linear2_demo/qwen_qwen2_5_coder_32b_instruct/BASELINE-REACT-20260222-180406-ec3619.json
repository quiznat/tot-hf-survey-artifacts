    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations to understand what is being asked. The input shows two equations with three numbers each: [5, 7, -12] and [-3, -1, -12]. \n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that in both equations, the third number is -12. This suggests these might be systems of equations where we're looking for values that satisfy both equations simultaneously.\n\nHowever, since no specific question is asked (like \"solve for x and y\" or \"find the solution\"), I should clarify what exactly needs to be done with these equations.\n\nLet me reconsider - these could be written as:\n- Equation 1: 5x + 7y = -12  \n- Equation 2: -3x + (-1)y = -12\n\nBut without a clear instruction on what to do with these equations, I cannot proceed with any action.\n\nFINAL:",
