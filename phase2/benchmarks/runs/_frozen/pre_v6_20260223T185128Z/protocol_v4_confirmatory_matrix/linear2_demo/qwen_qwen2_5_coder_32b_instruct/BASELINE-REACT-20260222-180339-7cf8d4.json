The input shows two equations with three coefficients each, which likely represent linear equations in the form ax + by = c.\n\nLooking at the equations:\n- First equation: [-6, -7, -6] represents -6x - 7y = -6\n- Second equation: [-8, 1, -8] represents -8x + y = -8\n\nI need to solve this system of linear equations. Since no tools are available, I'll solve it manually using substitution or elimination method.\n\nLet me use the elimination method:\nEquation 1: -6x - 7y = -6\nEquation 2: -8x + y = -8\n\nFrom equation 2: y = 8x - 8\n\nSubstituting into equation 1:\n-6x - 7(8x - 8) = -",
