    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations to understand what's being asked. The input shows two equations with three numbers each: [8, 7, 97] and [-5, -4, -58]. \n\nLooking at these patterns, I can see this might be representing linear equations in the form ax + by = c where:\n- First equation: 8x + 7y = 97\n- Second equation: -5x + (-4)y = -58 (or -5x - 4y = -58)\n\nHowever, since no tools are available and I'm asked to solve this, I should consider if there's a simpler interpretation. These could just be coefficients for a system of linear equations that I need to solve.\n\nLet me treat them as:\nEquation 1: 8x + 7y = 97\nEquation 2: -5x -",

Let me rewrite the equations clearly:\n\nEquation 1: 8x + 7y = 97\nEquation 2: -5x - 4y = -58\n\nI'll solve this system using elimination method.\n\nFirst, I'll multiply Equation 1 by 5 and Equation 2 by 8 to eliminate x:\n- Equation 1 \u00d7 5: 40x + 35y = 485\n- Equation 2 \u00d7 8: -40x - 32y = -464\n\nAdding these equations:\n(40x - 40x) + (35y - 32y) = 485 - 464\n3y = 21\ny = 7\n\nNow I'll substitute y = 7",
