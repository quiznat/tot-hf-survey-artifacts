    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of linear equations with two equations and two variables. The equations are:\n- 5x - y = 31\n- 3x + 4y = 14\n\nI'll use the substitution or elimination method to solve this system.\n\nLet me use the elimination method. First, I'll multiply the first equation by 4 to eliminate y when adding:\n- First equation \u00d7 4: 20x - 4y = 124\n- Second equation: 3x + 4y = 14\n\nAdding these equations: 23x = 138\nTherefore: x = 6\n\nNow I'll substitute x = 6 into the first original equation:\n5(6) - y = 31\n30 - y = 31\n-y = 1\ny = -1\n\nLet me verify with both equations",
