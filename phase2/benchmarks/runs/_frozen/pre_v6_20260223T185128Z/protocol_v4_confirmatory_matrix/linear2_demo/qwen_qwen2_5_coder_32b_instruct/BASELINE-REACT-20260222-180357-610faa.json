    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations to understand what task is being asked. The input contains two equations represented as lists of three numbers each: [6, 0, 24] and [3, -3, 9]. These appear to be linear equations in the form ax + by = c where:\n- First equation: 6x + 0y = 24\n- Second equation: 3x + (-3)y = 9\n\nSince no tools are available, I'll solve this system of equations manually using substitution or elimination method.\n\nLet me rewrite the equations clearly:\n1) 6x + 0y = 24 \u2192 6x = 24 \u2192 x = 4\n2) 3x - 3y = 9\n\nNow I can substitute x = 4 into the second equation:\n3(4) - 3y = 9\n12",
