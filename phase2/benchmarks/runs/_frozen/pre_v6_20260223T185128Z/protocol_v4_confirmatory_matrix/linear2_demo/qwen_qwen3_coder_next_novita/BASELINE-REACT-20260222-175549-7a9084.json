    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations of the form ax + by = c. We have two equations:  \n1) 8x + 7y = 97  \n2) -5x - 4y = -58  \n\nWe need to solve this system for x and y. Let's solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, write the system:\n8x + 7y = 97  ...(1)  \n-5x - 4y = -58 ...(2)\n\nWe can use elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination.\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 4 and equation (2) by 7 to eliminate y:\n\n(1) \u00d7 4: 32x + 28y = 388  \n(2) \u00d7 7: -35x - 28y",
