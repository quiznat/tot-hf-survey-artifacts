    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\n1) -2x + 2y = -2  \n2) 9x + 7y = 137  \n\nWe need to solve this system of equations for x and y.\n\nLet\u2019s simplify the first equation:  \n-2x + 2y = -2  \nDivide both sides by 2:  \n-x + y = -1  \n\u2192 y = x - 1  \n\nNow substitute into the second equation:  \n9x + 7(x - 1) = 137  \n9x + 7x - 7 = 137  \n16x = 144  \nx = 9  \n\nThen y = x - 1 = 8  \n\nSo solution is x = 9,",
