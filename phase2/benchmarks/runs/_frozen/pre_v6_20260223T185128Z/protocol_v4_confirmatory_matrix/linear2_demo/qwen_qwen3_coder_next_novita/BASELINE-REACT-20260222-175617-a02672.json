    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations in the form ax + by = c. So we have:\n\n1) 5x - 2y = 46  \n2) 9x + y = 46  \n\nWe need to solve this system of equations for x and y.\n\nLet\u2019s solve using substitution or elimination. From equation (2):  \ny = 46 - 9x\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):  \n5x - 2(46 - 9x) = 46  \n5x - 92 + 18x = 46  \n23x - 92 = 46  \n23x = 138  \nx = 6\n\nNow plug x = 6 into y = 46 - 9x:  \ny = 46 -",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the calculation: y = 46 - 9\u00d76 = 46 - 54 = -8. So the solution is x = 6, y = -8. Let\u2019s verify with the first equation: 5\u00d76 - 2\u00d7(-8) = 30 + 16 = 46 \u2014 correct. Second equation: 9\u00d76 + (-8) = 54 - 8 = 46 \u2014 correct. The system is solved. Since no tools are available and the task is to compute the solution, the final answer is the pair (x, y) = (6, -8).",
