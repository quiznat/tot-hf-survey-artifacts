    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations of the form ax + by = c. We have two equations:  \n1) 9x + 9y = 99  \n2) -7x + 5y = 19  \n\nWe need to solve this system for x and y. Let's simplify and solve step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify equation 1: divide both sides by 9 \u2192 x + y = 11 \u2192 y = 11 - x.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:  \n-7x + 5(11 - x) = 19  \n\u2192 -7x + 55 - 5x = 19  \n\u2192 -12x + 55 = 19  \n\u2192 -12x = 19 - 55 = -36",
