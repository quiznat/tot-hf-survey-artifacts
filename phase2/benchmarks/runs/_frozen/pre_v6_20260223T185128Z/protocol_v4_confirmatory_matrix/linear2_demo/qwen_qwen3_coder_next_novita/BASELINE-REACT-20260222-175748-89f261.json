    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides a list of equations in the form of coefficients. Each inner list appears to represent a linear equation in two variables, say x and y, of the form: a*x + b*y = c. However, the lists have only two coefficients, not three. Wait \u2014 looking again: `[[0, -9, 72], [-2, 1, -12]]` \u2014 each has three numbers. So likely each is: a*x + b*y = c, i.e.,  \nEquation 1: 0*x + (-9)*y = 72 \u2192 -9y = 72  \nEquation 2: -2*x + 1*y = -12 \u2192 -2x + y = -12  \n\nWe can solve this system. From Eq1: -9y = 72 \u2192 y = -8.  \nPlug into Eq2: -2",
