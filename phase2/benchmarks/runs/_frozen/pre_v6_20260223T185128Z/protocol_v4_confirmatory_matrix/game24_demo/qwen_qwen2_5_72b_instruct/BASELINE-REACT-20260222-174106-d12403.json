However, a common task with such inputs is to find the sum, product, maximum, minimum, or sort the list. Since there are no tools available, I will assume the simplest and most common task, which is to find the sum of the numbers.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the list [3, 1, 5, 1].\n\nFINAL: 10",
