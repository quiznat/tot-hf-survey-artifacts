    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is not specified clearly, but with the input given as a list of numbers [2, 2, 8, 10] and no available tools, it seems like I might need to perform some kind of mathematical operation or analysis on these numbers. Since there are no specific instructions or tools provided, I should start by considering common tasks that could be performed with such a list, such as calculating the sum, average, or finding the maximum and minimum values. However, without more context, the most straightforward action is to provide the input itself as the answer, assuming that the task is simply to return the input.\n\nFINAL: [2, 2, 8, 10]"
