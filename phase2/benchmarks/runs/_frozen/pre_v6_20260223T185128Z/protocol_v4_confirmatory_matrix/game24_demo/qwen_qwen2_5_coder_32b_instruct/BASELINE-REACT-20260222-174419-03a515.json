Let me analyze the sequence [8, 9, 7, 8] to see if there's an obvious pattern or calculation needed.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 8, 9, 7, 8\n- The first and last numbers are the same (8)\n- The middle two numbers are 9 and 7\n- This could be a symmetric pattern around the center\n\nLet me consider what might be the expected output.
