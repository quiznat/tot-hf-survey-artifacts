    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I need to determine what operation or pattern is being asked for with the input [2, 10, 10, 3]. Since no tools are available, I must rely on basic mathematical reasoning. Looking at the numbers, I see two 10s in the middle, which suggests a possible symmetric pattern or repeated element. The simplest meaningful operation would be to calculate the sum of all numbers: 2 + 10 + 10 + 3 = 25. This seems like the most logical interpretation given the lack of additional context or tools.\n\nFINAL: 25"
