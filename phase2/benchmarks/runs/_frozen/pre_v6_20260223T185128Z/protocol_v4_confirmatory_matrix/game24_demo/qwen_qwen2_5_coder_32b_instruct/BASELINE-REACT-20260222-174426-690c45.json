The most common benchmark tasks with arrays involve sorting, finding maximum/minimum values, or performing some mathematical operation on the elements.\n\nLooking at the numbers [8, 5, 4, 6], I can see they're not in sorted order. A typical benchmark task might be to sort them in ascending order, which would be [4, 5, 6, 8].\n\nLet me check if there's another interpretation - perhaps finding the sum, maximum, minimum, or average. The sum is 8+5+4+6 = 23, maximum is 8, minimum is 4, average is 23/4 = 5.75.\n\nSince the task doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done",

Since no tools are available and the task isn't explicitly defined, I should consider the most common benchmark operations that can be performed manually on arrays.\n\nThe most straightforward and commonly tested benchmark task would be sorting the array in ascending order. This is a fundamental operation that tests understanding of basic algorithms and ordering principles.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate basic statistics like sum, max, min, or average, but sorting is more likely to be the intended benchmark task given the nature of the input data.\n\nLet me sort the array [8, 5, 4, 6] in ascending order:\n- Start with [8, 5, 4, 6]\n- Find smallest element: 4\n- Find next smallest: 5  \n- Find next smallest: 6\n- Find largest: 8",

Another possibility is calculating the sum (23) or average (5.75). \n\nSince I cannot use any tools and need to provide an answer, I'll go with the most fundamental operation - finding the maximum value in the array, which is clearly 8.\n\nFINAL: 8"
