    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [8, 10, 5, 2]. Since no tools are available, I need to think through this problem manually. The most common benchmark tasks with arrays involve finding patterns, sorting, or performing calculations. Looking at these numbers, I can see they're not in order. Let me consider what the task might be asking for.\n\nThe simplest interpretation is to sort the array in ascending order, which would be the most typical benchmark task for an array. I'll sort [8, 10, 5, 2] from smallest to largest.\n\nACTION: sort [8, 10, 5, 2]\n\nWait, I don't have a sorting tool available. Let me reconsider - since I have no tools, I should just think about what the sorted version would be and provide that as my answer.\n\nLooking at [8, 10,",

Since I cannot use any tools, I need to determine what the most likely benchmark task is and solve it through reasoning alone.\n\nThe most common benchmark task with arrays is sorting. I need to arrange these numbers in ascending order (smallest to largest).\n\nLet me compare the numbers:\n- 2 is the smallest\n- 5 is the next smallest  \n- 8 is the next smallest\n- 10 is the largest\n\nSo the sorted array should be [2, 5, 8, 10].\n\nFINAL: [2, 5, 8, 10]"
