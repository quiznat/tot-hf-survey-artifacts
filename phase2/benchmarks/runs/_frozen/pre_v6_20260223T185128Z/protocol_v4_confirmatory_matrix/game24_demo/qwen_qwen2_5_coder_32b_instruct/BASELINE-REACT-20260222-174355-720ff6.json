    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [3, 1, 8, 5]. Since no tools are available, I need to think through this step by step. The most common benchmark tasks with arrays involve sorting, finding maximum/minimum values, or performing some mathematical operation. Looking at the numbers [3, 1, 8, 5], I should consider what the most likely task is.\n\nLet me consider if this is asking for sorting - arranging the numbers in ascending order would give us [1, 3, 5, 8].\n\nAlternatively, it could be asking for the maximum value, which would be 8, or minimum value which would be 1.\n\nSince no specific instruction was given about what to do with these numbers, and sorting is a very common benchmark task, I'll assume they want the sorted array.\n\nACTION: sort [3, 1, 8, 5",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I see that I don't have access to a sorting tool, so I need to think through how to sort the array [3, 1, 8, 5] manually. Since I can't use any tools, I need to reason through the sorting process step by step.\n\nLooking at the numbers [3, 1, 8, 5], I need to arrange them in ascending order:\n- First, I identify the smallest number: 1\n- Next smallest: 3  \n- Next smallest: 5\n- Largest: 8\n\nSo the sorted array should be [1, 3, 5, 8].\n\nFINAL: [1, 3, 5, 8]"
