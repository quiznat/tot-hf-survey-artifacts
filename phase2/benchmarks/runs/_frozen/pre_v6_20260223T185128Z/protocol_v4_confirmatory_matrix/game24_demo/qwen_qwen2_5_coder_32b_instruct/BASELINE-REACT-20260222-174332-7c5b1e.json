    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [5, 9, 10, 6]. Since no tools are available, I need to think through what kind of benchmark task this could be. This looks like a list of numbers, so it could be asking for:\n- Sorting the numbers\n- Finding the sum\n- Finding the maximum or minimum\n- Arranging in a specific pattern\n\nLet me consider the most common benchmark tasks with arrays of numbers. The most likely candidates would be sorting or finding basic statistics.\n\nSince I can't use any tools, I'll need to perform these operations manually.\n\nLooking at the numbers [5, 9, 10, 6], let me sort them in ascending order as that's a common benchmark task.\n\nFINAL: [5, 6, 9, 10]"
