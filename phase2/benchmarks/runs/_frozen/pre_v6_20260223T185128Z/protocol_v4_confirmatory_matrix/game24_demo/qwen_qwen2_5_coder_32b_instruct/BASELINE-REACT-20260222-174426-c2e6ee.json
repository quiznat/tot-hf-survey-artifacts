    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [2, 2, 8, 10]. Since no tools are available, I need to think through this problem manually. The most common benchmark tasks with arrays involve finding patterns, calculating sums, products, or identifying specific properties. Let me consider what mathematical operations or patterns might be relevant.\n\nLooking at [2, 2, 8, 10], I notice:\n- Two 2's appear\n- The numbers are 2, 2, 8, 10\n- This could be about finding a pattern, sum, product, or some other mathematical relationship\n\nSince I have no tools available, I'll consider if there's a simple mathematical operation that could be the answer. The most straightforward approach would be to calculate the sum or product, or look for a pattern.\n\nLet me try calculating the sum: 2 + 2 + 8",
