    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [7, 3, 5, 1]. Since no tools are available, I need to think through this step by step. The most common benchmark tasks with arrays involve sorting, finding maximum/minimum values, or performing some mathematical operation. Looking at the numbers [7, 3, 5, 1], I can see they're not in order. Let me consider what the most likely task might be.\n\nThe simplest interpretation is to sort these numbers in ascending order, which would be [1, 3, 5, 7]. This is a standard benchmark task that doesn't require any special tools.\n\nFINAL: [1, 3, 5, 7]"
