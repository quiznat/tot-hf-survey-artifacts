    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [4, 10, 1, 1] using a ReAct loop. However, I don't have access to any tools. This appears to be a simple arithmetic or logic problem that I can solve directly.\n\nLooking at the input [4, 10, 1, 1], I should consider what operation might be appropriate. Since no specific operation was mentioned and I have no tools available, I'll assume this is asking for a basic calculation or pattern recognition.\n\nThe most straightforward interpretation would be to sum all numbers: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16.\n\nFINAL: 16"
