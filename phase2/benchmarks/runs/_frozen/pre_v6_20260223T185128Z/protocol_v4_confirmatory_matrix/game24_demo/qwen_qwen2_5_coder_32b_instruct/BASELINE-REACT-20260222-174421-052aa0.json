The most common benchmark tasks with arrays involve finding patterns, sorting, or performing mathematical operations. Let me consider what might be the intended operation.\n\nLooking at the numbers [9, 3, 5, 4], I could:\n1. Sort them in ascending order: [3, 4, 5, 9]\n2. Sort them in descending order: [9, 5, 4, 3]\n3. Find the sum: 9 + 3 + 5 + 4 = 21\n4. Find the maximum value: 9\n5.

The most reasonable interpretation of a \"benchmark task\" with an array of numbers would be to find a simple summary statistic.
