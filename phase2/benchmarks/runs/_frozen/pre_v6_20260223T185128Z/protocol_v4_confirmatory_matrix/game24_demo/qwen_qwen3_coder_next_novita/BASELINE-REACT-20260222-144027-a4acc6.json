    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [7, 3, 5, 1]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks include sorting, summing, finding min/max, or identifying patterns. Since the numbers are small and distinct, sorting them in ascending or descending order is a plausible default. Sorting [7, 3, 5, 1] ascending gives [1, 3, 5, 7]. Alternatively, descending would be [7, 5, 3, 1]. Without further context, ascending order is the most standard interpretation. I'll go with that.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [7, 3, 5, 1], and no tools are available. Since no explicit task is specified, the most common benchmark task with a list of numbers is to sort it in ascending order. Sorting [7, 3, 5, 1] yields [1, 3, 5, 7]. This is a well-defined, deterministic output and aligns with typical expectations for such benchmarks. No further reasoning or tools are needed.",
