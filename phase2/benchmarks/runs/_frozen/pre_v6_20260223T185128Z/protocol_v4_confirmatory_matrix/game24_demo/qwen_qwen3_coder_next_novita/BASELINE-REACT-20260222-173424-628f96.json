    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and no tools are available. This suggests the task may be to compute something from the list \u2014 perhaps a sum, product, mean, or check for some property (e.g., can we make 24 using arithmetic operations?). Since this resembles the classic \"24 game\", let\u2019s test if [3, 4, 4, 8] can make 24 using basic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses). Try combinations:\n\n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, and 4 \u2212 4 = 0 \u2192 24 + 0 = 24 \u2192 (8 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u2212 4) = 24 \u2705  \n- Or (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but no 2.  \n- Another: 4",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and no tools are available. Given the numbers and common benchmark patterns (e.g., 24 game), I should verify if they can form 24 using basic arithmetic operations. As noted: (8 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u2212 4) = 24 + 0 = 24. This uses all four numbers exactly once. So the answer is likely \"Yes\" or the expression itself. Since the task format expects a final answer, and no specific instruction is given, the most reasonable interpretation is to confirm that 24 is achievable.",
