    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [8, 9, 7, 8]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks include computing the sum, average, max, min, or identifying patterns. Since the numbers are small and the list is short, the most straightforward interpretation is to compute the sum. Let's compute it: 8 + 9 = 17, 17 + 7 = 24, 24 + 8 = 32. So the sum is 32. Alternatively, maybe it's about sorting, but sorting [8,9,7,8] gives [7,8,8,9], which seems less likely as a final answer without context. Given typical benchmark tasks, sum is a safe default. I'll go with sum = 32.",
