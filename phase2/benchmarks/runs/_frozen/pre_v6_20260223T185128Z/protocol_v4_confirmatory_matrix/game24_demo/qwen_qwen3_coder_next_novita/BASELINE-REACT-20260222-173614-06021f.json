The input [9, 10, 6, 1] sorted ascending is [1, 6, 9, 10]. Alternatively, summing gives 26, but sorting is a standard baseline operation. Given the ambiguity, I\u2019ll choose sorting as the most neutral and frequently used benchmark operation for lists.",

Common operations on numeric lists include sorting, summing, finding min/max, or computing product. Sorting is a fundamental and frequently used benchmark operation for lists. Sorting [9, 10, 6, 1] in ascending order yields [1, 6, 9, 10]. This is deterministic, unambiguous, and aligns with typical ReAct-style reasoning tasks where ordering is expected. Other options (e.g., sum = 26) are possible, but sorting is more canonical for list inputs without further context.",
