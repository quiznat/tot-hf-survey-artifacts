    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [1, 6, 2, 7]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks include sorting, summing, finding min/max, or identifying patterns. Since the numbers are small and the list is short, a likely goal is to sort them in ascending or descending order. Let\u2019s consider sorting ascending: [1, 2, 6, 7]. Alternatively, maybe it's about forming the largest or smallest number by concatenation \u2014 e.g., largest would be 7621, smallest 1267. But without explicit instructions, the most neutral and standard interpretation is to sort the list. Since the instruction says \"Respond using one of: ... FINAL: <answer>\", and no tool is needed, I\u2019ll output the sorted list as the answer.\n\nFINAL: [1"
