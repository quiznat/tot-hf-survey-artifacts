    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of four numbers: [7, 5, 8, 8]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". In many benchmark tasks involving numbers, the goal is often to compute a result using arithmetic operations (e.g., reach 24 using all numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses). Let\u2019s test that hypothesis.\n\nWe have numbers: 7, 5, 8, 8.\n\nTry to reach 24.\n\nCommon strategies:\n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2192 can we make 3 from 7, 5, 8? (e.g., (7 + 5) / 4, but no 4). Alternatively, (8 / (7 - 5)) = 4, then 8 \u00d7 3? Not matching.\n\nTry: (8 \u2212",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [7, 5, 8, 8], and no tools are available. Since this is a benchmark task with only numbers and no explicit instructions, the most common such task is the \"24 Game\": use all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. Let\u2019s systematically search for a solution.\n\nWe have two 8s, 7, and 5.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 8 \u00d7 (something) = 24 \u2192 need 3 from [7, 5, 8]. Can we get 3? (8 \u2212 5) = 3, but then we\u2019d have 7 left unused. Not allowed \u2014 must use all four numbers.\n\n- Try (8 + 8) = 16. Then need 8 more from 7 and 5: 7 + 5 =",

That uses all four numbers: 8, 7, 5, 8 \u2014 exactly once.\n\nBreakdown:\n- 7 \u2212 5 = 2  \n- 8 \u00d7 2 = 16  \n- 16 + 8 = 24  \n\nAll numbers used, valid operations.\n\nSo the answer is the expression (8 \u00d7 (7 \u2212 5)) + 8 = 24, or just the result 24 if the task is to compute the target.\n\nSince the benchmark likely expects the solution value (24) or the expression, and given typical 24 Game",
