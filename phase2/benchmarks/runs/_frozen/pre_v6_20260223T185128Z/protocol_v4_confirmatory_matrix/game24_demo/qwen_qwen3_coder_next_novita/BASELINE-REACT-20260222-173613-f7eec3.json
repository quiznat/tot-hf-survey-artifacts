    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [8, 10, 5, 2]. No tools are available, and no specific task is described beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks include sorting, summing, finding min/max, or computing some aggregate. Since no instruction is given, I should consider the most neutral or standard interpretation \u2014 perhaps sorting the list in ascending order, as that's a common baseline. Alternatively, maybe the task is to return the list as-is, but that seems unlikely. Let me consider possible interpretations:\n\n- Sum: 8 + 10 + 5 + 2 = 25  \n- Product: 8 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 2 = 800  \n- Sorted ascending: [2, 5, 8, 10]  \n- Sorted descending: [10, 8, 5,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [8, 10, 5, 2], and no specific task or tools are provided. In benchmark tasks without explicit instructions, a common default is to sort the list in ascending order. Alternatively, computing the sum (25) or returning the sorted list are standard expectations. Since sorting is a fundamental operation and often used as a baseline, I'll proceed with sorting the list in ascending order. The sorted list is [2, 5, 8, 10].",
