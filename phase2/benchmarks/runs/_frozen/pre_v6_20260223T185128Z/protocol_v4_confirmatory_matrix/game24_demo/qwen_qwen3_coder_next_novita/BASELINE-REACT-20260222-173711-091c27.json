    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [7, 7, 3, 8] and no available tools. Since no tools are provided and no specific task is defined (e.g., arithmetic, sorting, pattern recognition), I need to infer the most likely benchmark task. Common benchmarks with number lists include computing the result of applying operations in order (e.g., 7 + 7 + 3 + 8 = 25), or perhaps forming the largest number (7738), or checking for a specific property.\n\nGiven the numbers [7, 7, 3, 8], a typical benchmark could be to compute the sum: 7 + 7 + 3 + 8 = 25. Alternatively, it could be to compute the product: 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 8 = 1176. But without explicit",
