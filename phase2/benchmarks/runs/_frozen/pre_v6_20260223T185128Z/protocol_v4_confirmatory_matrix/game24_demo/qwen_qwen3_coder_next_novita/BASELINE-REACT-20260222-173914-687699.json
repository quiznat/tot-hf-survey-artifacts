    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop, with input [2, 2, 8, 10] and no available tools. Since no tools are available and no specific task is defined (e.g., \"find the sum\", \"sort\", \"find target\", etc.), I need to infer the most likely benchmark task. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include: computing the sum, product, mean, median, mode, max, min, or solving a 24-game-style puzzle (using arithmetic operations to reach 24). Given the numbers [2, 2, 8, 10], a classic 24-game check is plausible.\n\nLet\u2019s test if 24 is achievable:\n- Try: (10 + 2) \u00d7 (2) = 24 \u2192 but we have four numbers: 2, 2, 8, 10",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let\u2019s explore the 24-game possibility more thoroughly with [2, 2, 8, 10]. We need to use all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses.\n\nTry combinations:\n- (10 \u2212 8) = 2 \u2192 then 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 8 \u2192 too small.\n- 10 + 8 + 2 + 2 = 22 \u2192 close.\n- 10 \u00d7 2 + 8 \u2212 2 = 20 + 6 = 26.\n- 10 \u00d7 2 + 2 + 2 = 24! Wait: 10 \u00d7 2 = 20, +2 +2 = 24. That uses 10, 2, 2, 2 \u2014 but we only have two 2s, not three",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Let's re-express the valid expression carefully. We have numbers [2, 2, 8, 10]. Try: (10 + 2) \u00d7 (8 \u00f7 2) = 12 \u00d7 4 = 48 \u2014 too big. Try: (10 \u2212 2) \u00d7 (8 \u2212 2) = 8 \u00d7 6 = 48. Try: 10 \u00d7 (8 \u00f7 2) \u2212 2 = 10 \u00d7 4 \u2212 2 = 40 \u2212 2 = 38. Try: (8 \u00d7 2) + (10 \u2212 2) = 16 + 8 = 24! Yes!

This satisfies the classic 24-game benchmark task, which is a common benchmark when given four numbers and no explicit instruction. Since no tools are available and the task is to solve the benchmark, the answer is the expression or confirmation that 24 is achievable.",
