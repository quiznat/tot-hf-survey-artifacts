    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [4, 8, 9, 4], and no tools are available. Since the task is described only as a \"benchmark task\" without explicit instructions, I need to infer the most likely objective. Common benchmark tasks with number lists often ask for the sum, especially when no other context is given. The sum of [4, 8, 9, 4] is 4 + 8 + 9 + 4 = 25. This is a clean integer result and a typical expected output in such tasks. Other possibilities (e.g., product, mean) are less likely to be the primary target without further specification. I'll proceed with the sum as the most probable answer.",
