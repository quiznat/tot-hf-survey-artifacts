Common tasks with number lists include sorting, computing aggregates, or pattern recognition. Sorting ascending is a very standard default (e.g., in sorting benchmarks), yielding [1, 6, 7, 10]. Alternatively, summing gives 24, but sorting is more fundamental and unambiguous for raw list input. Given the lack of context, sorted ascending is a reasonable and widely expected output.",

Sorting ascending is a standard default in many benchmarks (e.g., sorting algorithms), yielding [1, 6, 7, 10]. Other possibilities like sum (24), max (10), or mean (6) are less universally expected for raw list input without context.
