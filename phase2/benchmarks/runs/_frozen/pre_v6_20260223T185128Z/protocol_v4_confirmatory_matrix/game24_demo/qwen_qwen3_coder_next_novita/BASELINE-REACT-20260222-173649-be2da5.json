    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [5, 5, 5, 6], and no tools are available. Since this is a benchmark task and no specific instruction is given, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve operations like sum, product, average, or identifying patterns. Let\u2019s consider possible interpretations:\n\n- Sum: 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 21  \n- Product: 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 6 = 750  \n- Average: 21 / 4 = 5.25  \n- Mode: 5 (appears most frequently)  \n- Median: (5 + 5)/2 = 5  \n- Min/Max: 5 and 6  \n\nBut without explicit instructions, the most neutral and common interpretation for such a list in benchmark tasks is often the **sum**, especially if it's a simple",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [5, 5, 5, 6], and no tools are available. Since no explicit instruction is given, I must infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with numeric lists often ask for the sum, especially when the list is short and simple. Calculating the sum: 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 21. This is straightforward, unambiguous, and a typical default in such contexts. Other interpretations (e.g., product, average, mode) are possible but less likely as the primary expectation without further context.",
