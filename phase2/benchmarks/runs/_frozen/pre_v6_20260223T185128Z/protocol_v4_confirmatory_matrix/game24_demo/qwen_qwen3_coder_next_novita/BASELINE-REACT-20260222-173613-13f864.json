    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of four numbers: [7, 5, 8, 8]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". This likely implies a common puzzle type: using the numbers 7, 5, 8, 8 with arithmetic operations to reach 24 (the classic 24 game). Let\u2019s test if that\u2019s the case.\n\nWe need to use all four numbers exactly once, with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses, to make 24.\n\nTry combinations:\n\n- (8 \u00f7 (8 \u2212 5)) \u00d7 7 = (8 \u00f7 3) \u00d7 7 \u2248 18.67 \u2192 no  \n- (8 \u00d7 5) \u2212 (8 + 7) = 40 \u2212 15 = 25 \u2192 close  \n- (8 + 8",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [7, 5, 8, 8], and no tools are available. Since this is a benchmark task with no explicit instructions, the most common interpretation in such puzzles is the 24 Game: use all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. Let\u2019s continue exploring combinations.\n\nWe tried a few, but need a systematic approach.\n\nTry:  \n(8 \u00d7 (7 \u2212 5)) + 8 = (8 \u00d7 2) + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24 \u2705  \nYes! That uses all numbers: 8, 7, 5, 8 \u2014 each exactly once.  \nOperations: subtraction (7 \u2212 5), multiplication (8 \u00d7 result), addition (+ 8).  \nParentheses ensure correct order.\n\nSo the solution is: (8 \u00d7 (7 \u2212",
