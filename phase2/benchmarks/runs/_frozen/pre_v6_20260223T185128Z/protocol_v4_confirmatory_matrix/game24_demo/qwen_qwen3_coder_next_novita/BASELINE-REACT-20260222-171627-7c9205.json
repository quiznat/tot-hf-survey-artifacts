Common tasks with such inputs include computing the sum, counting elements, detecting alternation, or finding the mean. The sequence alternates strictly between 5 and 7, repeated twice. Given the symmetry and repetition, a frequent benchmark task is to compute the sum: 5 + 7 + 5 + 7 = 24. Alternatively, the mean is 6, but sum is more standard for raw numeric sequences in benchmarks unless otherwise specified. Since no further context is provided, the most straightforward and commonly expected answer is the sum.",
