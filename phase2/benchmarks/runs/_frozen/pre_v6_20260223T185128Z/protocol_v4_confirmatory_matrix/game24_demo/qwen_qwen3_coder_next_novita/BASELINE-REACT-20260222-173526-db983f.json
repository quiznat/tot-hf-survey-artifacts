    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [7, 9, 8, 5]. No tools are available, and no specific task is described beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks include sorting, summing, finding min/max, or identifying patterns. Since the numbers are small and unsorted, a likely goal is to sort them in ascending or descending order. Let\u2019s consider sorting ascending: [5, 7, 8, 9]. Alternatively, maybe it's to compute the sum: 7 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 29. Or perhaps to find the median, mean, etc. Without explicit instructions, the most neutral and common benchmark operation is sorting. I\u2019ll go with ascending sort as the answer.",
