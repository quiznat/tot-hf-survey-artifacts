    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [3, 1, 8, 5]. No tools are available, and no specific task is described beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks include sorting, summing, finding min/max, etc. Since the numbers are unsorted, a likely goal is to sort them in ascending order. Sorting [3, 1, 8, 5] yields [1, 3, 5, 8]. Alternatively, maybe the task is to compute the sum: 3 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 17. But without explicit instructions, sorting is a standard default for list inputs. However, the instruction says \"Respond using one of: ... FINAL: <answer>\", implying a single final answer is expected. Given ambiguity, I\u2019ll assume the most common benchmark operation on a list is sorting. So final answer is [1"
