    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [8, 10, 6, 7]. No tools are available, and no specific task is described beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks include sorting, summing, finding min/max, or identifying patterns. Since the numbers are small and unsorted, a likely goal is to sort them in ascending or descending order. Let\u2019s sort them ascending: 6, 7, 8, 10. Alternatively, maybe it's about arithmetic operations \u2014 e.g., sum = 8+10+6+7 = 31, min = 6, max = 10. But without explicit instructions, the most neutral and common benchmark operation is sorting. I\u2019ll go with sorted ascending as the answer.",
