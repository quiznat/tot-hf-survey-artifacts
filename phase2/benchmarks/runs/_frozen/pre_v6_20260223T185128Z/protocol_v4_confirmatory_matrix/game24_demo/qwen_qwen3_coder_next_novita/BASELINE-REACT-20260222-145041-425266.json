    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [5, 5, 5, 6], and no tools are available. Since this is a benchmark task and no specific instructions are given, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve operations like sum, product, mean, or identifying patterns. Let\u2019s consider possible interpretations:\n\n- Sum: 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 21  \n- Product: 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 6 = 750  \n- Mean: 21 / 4 = 5.25  \n- Mode: 5 (appears most frequently)  \n- Median: (5 + 5)/2 = 5  \n- Count: 4 elements  \n\nBut without explicit instructions, the most neutral and common interpretation for such a list in benchmark tasks is often the **sum**, especially if it's a simple arithmetic benchmark.\n\nAlternatively",

In many benchmark tasks involving numeric lists without explicit instructions, the most common expected output is the **sum** (e.g., in arithmetic reasoning or basic math benchmarks). Calculating: 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 21. Other possibilities like product, mean, or mode are less likely as default without context. Sum is the most straightforward and neutral interpretation.",
