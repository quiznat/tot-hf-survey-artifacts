    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [10, 2, 7, 10]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". In many benchmark tasks involving lists of numbers, common tasks include computing sum, product, mean, median, mode, max, min, sorting, or checking for duplicates. Given the list has a duplicate (10 appears twice), and numbers are small, perhaps the task is to find the mode (most frequent value), or sum, or maybe to sort. However, without explicit instruction, it's ambiguous.\n\nBut in many standard benchmark tasks (e.g., from MMLU, GSM8K, or similar), if only a list is given and no operation specified, sometimes the task is to compute the *sum* (e.g., \"What is the sum of [10, 2, 7, 10]?",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is a list of numbers [10, 2, 7, 10]. Since no specific operation is given, and no tools are available, I need to infer the most likely benchmark task. Common tasks with numeric lists include sum, product, mean, median, mode, or sorting. The list contains a duplicate (10 appears twice), so mode is possible, but sum is the most fundamental and frequently used operation in such benchmarks when unspecified. Calculating the sum: 10 + 2 + 7 + 10 = 29. This is straightforward and likely the intended task.",
