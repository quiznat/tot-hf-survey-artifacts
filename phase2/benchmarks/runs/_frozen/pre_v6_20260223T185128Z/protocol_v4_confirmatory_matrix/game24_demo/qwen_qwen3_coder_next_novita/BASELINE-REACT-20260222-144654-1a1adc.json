    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [8, 10, 5, 2]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks include computing sum, product, sorting, finding min/max, etc. Since the input is small and numbers are integers, a likely goal is to compute the sum. Let's compute: 8 + 10 = 18, 18 + 5 = 23, 23 + 2 = 25. Alternatively, could be sorting: [2, 5, 8, 10]. But without explicit instruction, sum is a standard default. However, the problem says \"benchmark task\" \u2014 perhaps it's expecting a specific known benchmark? Since no context is given, and no tools, the safest is to compute the sum as a simple, well-defined operation",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [8, 10, 5, 2], with no tools available and no explicit task description. In benchmark contexts without specification, common operations include sum, product, min, max, or sorting. Since the numbers are small integers, multiple interpretations are possible. However, sum is a canonical default for numeric lists in many benchmarks (e.g., evaluating arithmetic reasoning). Calculating: 8 + 10 = 18; 18 + 5 = 23; 23 + 2 = 25. Alternative interpretations (e.g., sorting \u2192 [2, 5, 8, 10]) are plausible but less universally standard without context. Given the ambiguity, sum remains the most reasonable first assumption. No action is needed\u2014this is reasoning only.\nFINAL: 25"
