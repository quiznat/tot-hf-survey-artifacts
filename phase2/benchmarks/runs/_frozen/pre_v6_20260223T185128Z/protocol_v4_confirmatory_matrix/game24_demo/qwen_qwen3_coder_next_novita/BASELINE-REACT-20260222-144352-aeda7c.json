    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 10, 6, 4]. Since no tools are available and no specific task is described, I need to infer what the benchmark task might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include: sorting, computing sum, product, mean, median, etc. Given the simplicity and typical nature of such tasks, sorting the list in ascending order is a plausible default. Sorting [2, 10, 6, 4] yields [2, 4, 6, 10]. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the sum: 2 + 10 + 6 + 4 = 22. But without explicit instructions, I should consider the most standard interpretation. In many coding benchmarks, \"process the list\" often implies sorting or computing a summary statistic. Since the numbers are small and distinct, sorting is straightforward and commonly expected.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [2, 10, 6, 4], and no tools are available. Since no explicit task is given, I must infer the most likely benchmark objective. Common tasks with numeric lists include sorting, summing, finding min/max, or computing mean/median. Sorting in ascending order is a standard default in many benchmarks (e.g., algorithmic sorting tasks). Sorting [2, 10, 6, 4] gives [2, 4, 6, 10]. Alternatively, the sum is 22, but sorting is more fundamental and unambiguous for this input. Given the absence of instructions, I'll proceed with sorting as the most reasonable interpretation.",
