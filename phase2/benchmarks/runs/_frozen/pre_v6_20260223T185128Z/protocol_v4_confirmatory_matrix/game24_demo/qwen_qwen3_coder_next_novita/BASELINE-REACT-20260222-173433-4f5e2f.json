Common tasks with number lists include sorting, computing sum, product, average, min/max, or pattern analysis. Sorting ascending is a standard baseline task in many benchmarks (e.g., for testing reasoning or sequence generation). Sorting [2, 10, 6, 4] gives [2, 4, 6, 10]. This is straightforward, unambiguous, and aligns with typical benchmark expectations when no explicit instruction is given.",
