    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop, with input [7, 7, 3, 8] and no available tools. Since no tools are available and no specific task is defined (e.g., arithmetic, sorting, pattern recognition), I need to infer the most likely intended task. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing the result of applying operations in order (e.g., using standard arithmetic operations), or computing something like sum, product, or applying a known puzzle rule (e.g., 24 game). Given the numbers [7, 7, 3, 8], a classic puzzle is to make 24 using all four numbers and basic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses). Let\u2019s test if 24 is achievable:\n\nTry:  \n7 + 7 + 3 + 8 = 25 \u2192 too high  \n7 \u00d7 3",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [7, 7, 3, 8], and no tools are available. Since this resembles the classic \"24 game\" puzzle\u2014where the goal is to use all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24\u2014I should attempt to find such an expression. Let me systematically test combinations.\n\nWe have two 7s, a 3, and an 8.\n\nTry:  \n(7 \u2212 3) \u00d7 (8 \u2212 2) \u2192 but no 2.  \n(8 \u2212 7) = 1, then 7 \u00d7 3 = 21, 21 + 1 = 22 \u2192 no.  \n8 \u00d7 3 = 24, then need to neutralize the two 7s: 24 + (7 \u2212 7) = 24. Yes!  \nSo",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The input [7, 7, 3, 8] strongly suggests a 24-game-style puzzle: use all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. A valid solution is 8 \u00d7 3 + (7 \u2212 7) = 24 + 0 = 24. This uses all numbers and basic operations. Since no tools are available and the task is to solve the benchmark (likely to produce 24), the answer is the expression or the result 24. Given typical expectations, the final answer is 24.",
