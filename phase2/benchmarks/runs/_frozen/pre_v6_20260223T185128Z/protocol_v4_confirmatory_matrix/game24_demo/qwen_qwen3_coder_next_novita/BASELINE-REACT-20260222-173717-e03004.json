    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [9, 9, 2, 4], and no tools are available. This suggests the task may be to compute something from the numbers \u2014 perhaps a mathematical expression or pattern. Common benchmark tasks with 4 numbers involve making 24 using arithmetic operations (the \"24 game\"). Let\u2019s check if that\u2019s the case.\n\nWe have numbers: 9, 9, 2, 4.\n\nTry to reach 24.\n\nPossible approaches:\n- 9 + 9 + 4 + 2 = 24 \u2192 9+9=18, 18+4=22, 22+2=24. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the answer is 24, achieved by summing all numbers.\n\nAlternatively, confirm uniqueness: Are there other operations? But since the task is likely to compute a result (and sum gives 24",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [9, 9, 2, 4], and no tools are available. This strongly suggests a classic \"24 game\" style problem where the goal is to combine the numbers using arithmetic operations to reach 24. Testing simple addition: 9 + 9 + 2 + 4 = 24. This works perfectly. Since the sum equals 24 and no other operations are required or indicated, the intended answer is 24.",
