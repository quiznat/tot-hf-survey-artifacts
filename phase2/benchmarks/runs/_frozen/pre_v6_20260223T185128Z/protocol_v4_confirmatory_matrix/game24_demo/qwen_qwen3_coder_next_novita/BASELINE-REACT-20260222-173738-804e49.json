    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop, with input [3, 3, 7, 1] and no available tools. Since no tools are available and the task is not explicitly specified, this likely is a \"24 game\" variant \u2014 where the goal is to use the four numbers exactly once with arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to make 24. Let\u2019s test if [3, 3, 7, 1] can make 24.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 7 \u00d7 3 = 21; 3 + 1 = 4; 21 + 4 = 25 \u2192 too high.\n- (7 + 1) \u00d7 3 = 24, but we have two 3s \u2014 need to use both. So (7 + 1) \u00d7 3 = 24",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: We need to use all four numbers [3, 3, 7, 1] exactly once with arithmetic operations to reach 24. Let\u2019s explore systematically.\n\nWe tried (7 + 1) \u00d7 3 = 24, but that uses only one 3 and ignores the second 3. So we need to incorporate both 3s.\n\nTry using division or subtraction to neutralize the extra 3, e.g., multiply by (3/3) = 1.\n\nSo: (7 + 1) \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (3 / 3) = 8 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 = 24 \u2014 but that uses *two* 3s in the multiplication and *one* more in division? Wait: (3 / 3) uses two 3s, and then another \u00d73 would be three 3s \u2014 too many.\n\nWe have only two 3",

Let\u2019s try more structured approaches.\n\nTry: (7 \u2212 1) \u00d7 3 + 3 = 6 \u00d7 3 + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \u2192 too low.\n\nTry: (7 + 1) \u00d7 (3 + 0) \u2014 but no 0.\n\nTry: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21; need +3 more \u2192 we have 3 and 1 left: 21 + 3 = 24, but that uses both 3s and 7, leaving 1 unused.

That works: 3 \u00d7 7 + 3 \u00d7 1 = 21 + 3 = 24. Parentheses aren\u2019t strictly needed due to operator precedence (\u00d7 before +), but to be explicit: (3 \u00d7 7) + (3 \u00d7 1) = 24.
