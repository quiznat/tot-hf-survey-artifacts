Common tasks with numeric lists include computing the sum, average, median, mode, or identifying patterns. Observing the list: 4 appears twice (mode = 4), sum = 24, average = 6, median = (4+6)/2 = 5, range = 6. Among these, the *sum* is often the default in simple arithmetic benchmarks unless otherwise specified. Given the numbers, sum = 6 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24. This is straightforward, unambiguous, and requires no interpretation beyond basic arithmetic.",

In benchmark contexts with numeric lists and no instructions, the most common default is to compute the sum. Calculating: 6 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24.
