    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 10, 6, 4]. Since no tools are available and no specific task is described (e.g., sort, sum, find max, etc.), I need to infer the most likely benchmark task. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include sorting, computing sum, finding min/max, or checking properties (e.g., even/odd). Given the numbers are all even, perhaps the task is to sort them. Sorting ascending gives [2, 4, 6, 10]. Alternatively, sum is 22, max is 10, min is 2. But without explicit instructions, the safest assumption is sorting \u2014 a standard benchmark operation. Let\u2019s sort the list in ascending order.\n\nFinal answer: [2, 4, 6, 10]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [2, 10, 6, 4]. No tools are available, and no explicit task is given. In benchmark contexts with numeric lists and no instructions, sorting is a canonical operation. Sorting ascending yields [2, 4, 6, 10]. Other possibilities (sum=22, max=10, min=2) are less likely as primary tasks without specification. Sorting is the most standard and unambiguous interpretation for such inputs in algorithmic benchmarks.\n\nFINAL: [2, 4, 6, 10]"
