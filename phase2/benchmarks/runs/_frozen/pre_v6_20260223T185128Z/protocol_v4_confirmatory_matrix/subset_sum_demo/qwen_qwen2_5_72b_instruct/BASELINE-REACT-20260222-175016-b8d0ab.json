    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find two numbers in the given list that add up to the target sum (17). I will use a two-pointer technique or a hash map to solve this efficiently, but since no tools are available, I'll proceed with a simple iteration and check for pairs.\n\nACTION: None required, proceeding with logic.\n\nTHINK: I will iterate through the list and for each number, I will check if there is another number in the list that, when added to it, equals the target sum. To do this, I can keep track of the complements (target - current number) as I go.\n\nLet's start with the first number, 2, and check if 17 - 2 = 15 is in the list.\n\nTHINK: 15 is in the list, so the pair (2, 15) adds up to 17.\n\nFINAL: [2, 1",

Since no external tools are available, I will solve this by iterating through the list and checking if the complement of the current number (i.e., `target - current number`) exists in the list.\n\nLet's begin with the first number in the list, which is 2. The complement would be 17 - 2 = 15. I will check if 15 is in the list.\n\nTHINK: 15 is indeed in the list, so the pair (2, 15) sums up to 17.\n\nFINAL: [2, 15]"
