Since there are no tools available, I will need to compute this manually through logic and reasoning. I should start by considering all possible combinations of the numbers to see if they can sum up to the target.\n\nACTION: None, since there are no tools to use, I will proceed with reasoning.\n\nTHINK: Let's break down the possibilities. The target is 55, and the numbers are [5, 6, 7, 18, 25]. A good starting point is to check if the target can be reached by using the largest number (25) and then trying to make up the difference with the remaining numbers.\n\nTHINK: If we subtract 25 from 55, we get 30.
