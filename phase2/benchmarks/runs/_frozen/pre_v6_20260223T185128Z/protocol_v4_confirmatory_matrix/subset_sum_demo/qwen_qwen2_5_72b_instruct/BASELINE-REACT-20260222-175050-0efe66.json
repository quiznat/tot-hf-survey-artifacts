    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task without any tools, I need to find two numbers from the given list that add up to the target number (17). I can do this by iterating through the list and checking if there is a complement number that adds up to 17.\n\nACTION: None, as there are no tools available, I will proceed with the reasoning step.\n\nTHINK: Starting with the first number in the list, 1, I need to check if 16 (17 - 1) is also in the list. If it is, then I have found my pair. If not, I will move on to the next number and repeat the process until I find a pair or conclude that no such pair exists.\n\nTHINK: Checking 1 + 16 = 17. Since 16 is in the list, I have found the pair (1, 16).\n\nFINAL: [1,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was an error in the previous response due to incorrect formatting. I will correct the approach and directly provide the answer based on the reasoning that has already been established.\n\nTHINK: The pair of numbers that add up to the target 17 is (1, 16), as 1 + 16 = 17.\n\nFINAL: [1, 16]"
