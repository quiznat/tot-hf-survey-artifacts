Given that there are no external tools available, I will use a simple algorithm to check each pair of numbers in the list to see if they sum up to the target.\n\nACTION: None, as we are performing the computation directly.\n\nTHINK: I will start by iterating through the list and for each number, I will check the rest of the list to find if there is another number that, when added to the current number, equals the target.\n\nTHINK: Let's begin with the first number in the list and check the rest of the list for a complement that adds up to 28.\n\nTHINK: 1 + (each of the other numbers) does not equal 28.
