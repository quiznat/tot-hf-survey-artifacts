    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to find a combination of numbers from the given list that adds up to the target number, which is 29 in this case. Since no tools are available, I will use a logical approach to identify the correct combination.\n\nTHINK: The list contains [1, 3, 4, 11, 21, 21]. The target is 29. I can start by trying to use the largest number and see if it helps me reach the target more efficiently.\n\nACTION: None (I will proceed with mental calculations)\n\nTHINK: Let's try using the largest number, 21. If I use one 21, I need another 8 to reach 29. Checking the remaining numbers, I see that 4 + 3 + 1 = 8. So, 21 + 4 + 3 + 1 =",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the format for the action step. Since no tools are available, I should focus on the logic to solve the problem directly. As reasoned before, using one 21 leaves me needing 8 more to reach the target of 29. The remaining numbers [1, 3, 4, 11, 21] can indeed sum up to 8 with 4 + 3 + 1.\n\nFINAL: [21, 4, 3, 1]"
