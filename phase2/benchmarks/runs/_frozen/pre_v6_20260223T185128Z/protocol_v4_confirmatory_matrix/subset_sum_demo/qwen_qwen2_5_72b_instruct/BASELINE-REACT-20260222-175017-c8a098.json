    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to find a combination of numbers from the given list that can be added together to reach the target of 37. Since there are no tools available, I will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations of the numbers.\n\nACTION: None needed, attempting to solve through reasoning and calculation.\n\nTHINK: Let's start with the largest number and see if we can get close to or exactly match the target. The largest number is 21. Subtracting 21 from 37 leaves us with 16. Now, I need to find a combination of the remaining numbers (2, 3, 4, 9) that add up to 16.\n\nTHINK: Trying the next largest number, 9, which leaves us with 7 when subtracted from 16. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 4. I can see",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It appears there was an unnecessary attempt to invoke a tool. Since no tools are available, I should focus on solving the problem directly. Continuing from the last step, after selecting 21 and 9, we are left with a remainder of 7 (since 37 - 21 - 9 = 7). We need to find a combination of the remaining numbers (2, 3, 4) that adds up to 7.\n\nTHINK: The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 4. If we add 3 and 4, we get 7 (3 + 4 = 7). This means the combination 21, 9, 3, and 4 adds up to 37.\n\nFINAL: [21, 9, 3, 4]"
