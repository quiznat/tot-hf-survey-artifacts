    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to require finding a subset of the given numbers that sums up to the target value. Since no tools are available, I need to solve this problem through logical reasoning and computation. A good approach would be to use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible subsets.\n\nACTION: None, but let's start by trying to find a subset that adds up to 61.\n\nTHINK: Starting with the largest number and working down, I can try to build a combination that sums to 61. Let's see if we can find such a subset without exceeding the target.\n\nTHINK: Let's start with 22 (the largest number) and see if adding other numbers gets us to 61:\n- 22 + 22 = 44 (still need 17 more)\n- 44 + 15 = 59 (still need 2 more)\n- 59",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It looks like there was an error in the previous step. Let's correct the approach and try to find a subset that sums to 61 using a systematic method. We'll start with the largest numbers and work our way down, ensuring we don't exceed the target.\n\nTHINK: Let's start with the largest number, 22, and see if we can find a combination:\n\n- 22 + 22 = 44 (still need 17 more)\n- 44 + 15 = 59 (still need 2 more)\n- 59 + 2 = 61\n\nTHINK: We found a combination that works: 22, 22, 15, and 2. This sums up to 61.\n\nFINAL: [22, 22, 15, 2]"
