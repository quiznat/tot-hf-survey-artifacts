    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem without any tools, I need to find a combination of the numbers that sums up to the target number (29). Given that we have a limited set of numbers and a specific target, a brute-force approach or checking combinations might be necessary. Let's start by trying to add the numbers to see if we can reach the target.\n\nACTION: None, but I will manually check combinations.\n- 5 + 5 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 29 (This is incorrect as it exceeds the target and doesn't use 10)\n- 5 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 24 (Close, but needs 5 more)\n- 5 + 5 + 10 + 7 = 27 (Close, but needs 2 more)\n- 5 + 7 + 10 + 7 = 29 (This is",

From the combinations checked, the last one seems to be correct: 5 + 7 + 10 + 7 = 29. Let's confirm this.\n\nFINAL: [5, 7, 10, 7]"
