    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find if there are any two numbers in the list that add up to the target number, 17. Since no external tools are available, I will use a simple algorithm to check each possible pair of numbers from the list.\n\nACTION: None needed, proceeding with logic.\n\nTHINK: I will iterate through the list and for each number, I will check if there is another number in the list that, when added to it, equals the target sum. To avoid duplicate checks, once I check a pair (i, j), I won't need to check (j, i) again.\n\nTHINK: Starting with the first number, 3, I will check if 17 - 3 = 14 is in the rest of the list. It is not. Moving to the next number, 5, I will check if 17 - 5 = 12",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was an attempt to use a tool, but since no tools are available, we should proceed with the reasoning and logic directly.\n\nTHINK: Continuing from where we left off, for the number 5, 17 - 5 = 12 is not in the list. Next, for the number 6, 17 - 6 = 11, which is in the list. This means the numbers 6 and 11 add up to the target number, 17.\n\nFINAL: [6, 11]"
