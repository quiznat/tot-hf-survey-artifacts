    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find a subset of the given numbers that sums up to the target value of 39. Since no external tools are available, I will use a simple algorithm to check combinations of these numbers to see if they can sum up to 39. I will start by trying larger combinations and then move to smaller ones if necessary.\n\nACTION: Next, I will manually attempt to combine the numbers to reach the target sum.\nTHINK: The largest number is 18, so I'll start with it and try to add other numbers to see if we can reach 39. 39 - 18 = 21. Now, I need to find numbers that sum up to 21 from the remaining list [3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13].\n\nACTION: Checking possible combinations for 21 from the remaining numbers.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was an error in my previous step because I incorrectly formatted the action. Let me correct this and proceed with finding a combination that sums up to 21 from the remaining numbers [3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13].\n\nACTION: Check combinations for 21 from the list [3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13].\nTHINK: Starting with the largest number in the subset, 13 + 8 = 21. This matches the required sum to reach 39 when added to 18.\n\nFINAL: [18, 13, 8]"
