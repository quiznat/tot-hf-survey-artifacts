    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find a subset of the given numbers that adds up to the target value of 60. Since no external tools are available, I will use a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of the numbers to see if they can sum up to 60.\nACTION: None, proceeding with backtracking algorithm.\nTHINK: Starting with an empty subset and adding elements one by one, I will check if the current sum equals the target. If it exceeds the target, I will backtrack and try another combination.\nTHINK: Let's start with the first number in the list.\nACTION: None, starting backtracking with [5].\nTHINK: Current subset is [5].
