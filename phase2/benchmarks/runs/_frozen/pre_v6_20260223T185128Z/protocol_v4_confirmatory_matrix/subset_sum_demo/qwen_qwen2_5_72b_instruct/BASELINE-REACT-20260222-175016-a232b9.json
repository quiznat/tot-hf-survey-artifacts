    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to find if there is a subset of the given list of numbers that sums up to the target value 37. Since no tools are available, I will use a brute force approach to check all possible combinations of the numbers to see if any of them add up to 37. I'll start with checking pairs, then move on to triples, and so on.\n\nACTION: None needed, proceed with reasoning.\n\nTHINK: Let's first check if any two numbers in the list sum up to 37.\n- 10 + 27 = 37 (but 27 is not in the list)\n- 13 + 24 = 37 (but 24 is not in the list)\n- 14 + 23 = 37 (but 23 is not in the list)\n- 17 + 20",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was an error because I mentioned an action when no tools are actually available. I'll correct that and continue with the reasoning. Let's check the pairs manually:\n\n- 10 + 27 = 37 (but 27 is not in the list)\n- 13 + 24 = 37 (but 24 is not in the list)\n- 14 + 23 = 37 (but 23 is not in the list)\n- 17 + 20 = 37\n\nI found a pair that adds up to 37: 17 and 20.\n\nFINAL: [17, 20]"
