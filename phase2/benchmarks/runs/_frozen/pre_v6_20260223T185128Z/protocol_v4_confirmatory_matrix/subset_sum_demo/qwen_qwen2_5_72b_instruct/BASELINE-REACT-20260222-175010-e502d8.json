    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to find two numbers in the given list that add up to the target number (21). Since there are no available tools, I will use a simple algorithm to check each pair of numbers to see if they sum up to the target.\n\nACTION: None required, as the task can be completed with basic logic and arithmetic operations.\n\nTHINK: I'll start by checking pairs of numbers in the list.\n\nTHINK: 8 + 11 = 19 (not equal to 21)\nTHINK: 8 + 12 = 20 (not equal to 21)\nTHINK: 8 + 13 = 21 (equal to 21, found the pair)\n\nFINAL: [8, 13]"
