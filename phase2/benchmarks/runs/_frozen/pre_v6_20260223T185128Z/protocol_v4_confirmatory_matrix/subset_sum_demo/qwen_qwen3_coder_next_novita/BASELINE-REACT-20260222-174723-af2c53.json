    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [6, 9, 9, 10, 17, 18, 18, 24] and a target of 27. The task is likely to find a subset (or some combination) of these numbers that sum to the target. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning problem.\n\nLet\u2019s look for combinations that sum to 27.\n\nFirst, check if any single number equals 27 \u2014 none do.\n\nCheck pairs:\n- 6 + 21 = 27 \u2192 no 21\n- 9 + 18 = 27 \u2192 yes! There are two 9s and two 18s. So 9 + 18 = 27 works.\n  - For example: pick the first 9 (index 1) and first 18 (index",
