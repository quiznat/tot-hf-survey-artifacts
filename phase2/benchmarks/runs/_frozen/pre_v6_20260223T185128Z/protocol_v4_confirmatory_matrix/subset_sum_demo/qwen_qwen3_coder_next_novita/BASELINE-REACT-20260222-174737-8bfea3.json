    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We need to use the numbers [1, 2, 5, 14, 17, 18] to make 24, using standard arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses). This is a variant of the 24 game, but with 6 numbers instead of 4. Let's explore combinations.\n\nFirst, note that 18 + 5 + 1 = 24, but then we\u2019d have leftover numbers 2, 14, 17 \u2014 we must use *all* numbers exactly once.\n\nSo we need an expression using all six numbers exactly once to equal 24.\n\nLet\u2019s consider grouping or canceling: maybe (18 + 17 + 5) \u2212 (14 + 2 + 1) = 40 \u2212 17 = 23 \u2014 close.\n\n(18 + 1",

Let\u2019s look for patterns or known tricks.\n\nObserve:\n- 18 + 5 + 1 = 24, but again, leftover numbers.\n- Try using subtraction to neutralize extra numbers: e.g., (18 + 5 + 1) + (2 \u2212 2) \u2014 but only one 2.\n- Maybe (17 + 1) = 18, and 18 \u2212 14 = 4, then 5 \u2212 2 = 3, and 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2014 not enough.\n\nTry pairing large numbers: 18 + 17 = 35; 14 +",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Let's try systematic approaches. Since 18 + 5 + 1 = 24, we need to make the remaining numbers (2, 14, 17) combine to 0. Can we get 0 from 2, 14, 17? Try 17 + 2 \u2212 14 = 5, not 0. 14 + 2 \u2212 17 = \u22121. 17 \u2212 14 \u2212 2 = 1. Not zero.\n\nWhat about 17 + 5 + 2 = 24, leftover 1, 14, 18. Can we make 0 from those? 18 + 1 \u2212 14 = 5. 14 + 1 \u2212 18 = \u22123.\n\nTry multiplication/division: 18 \u00f7 (17 \u2212",
    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: Let's try a more structured approach. Consider possible products or quotients that yield small integers, since 24 is modest and we have large numbers (14, 17, 18). For instance:\n\n- 18 \u00f7 (17 \u2212 14) = 18 \u00f7 3 = 6  \nNow we\u2019ve used 18, 17, 14 \u2192 remaining: 1, 2, 5  \nCan we make 4 from 1, 2, 5? Because 6 \u00d7 4 = 24.  \n5 \u2212 2 + 1 = 4 \u2192 yes!  \nSo: (18 \u00f7 (17 \u2212 14)) \u00d7 (5 \u2212 2 + 1) = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24  \nCheck: all numbers used exactly once: 18, 1",

All six numbers [1, 2, 5, 14, 17, 18] are used exactly once, and only standard arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) are used. This satisfies the task requirements.",
