    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [4, 5, 11, 11, 13, 16, 22] and a target: 51. The task is likely to find a subset (or some combination) of these numbers that sum to the target. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning problem.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a subset that sums to 51.\n\nFirst, total sum of all numbers: 4 + 5 + 11 + 11 + 13 + 16 + 22 = let's compute:\n4 + 5 = 9  \n9 + 11 = 20  \n20 + 11 = 31  \n31 + 13 = 44  \n44 + 16 = 60  \n60 + 22 = 8",

Target is 51, so we need a subset summing to 51 \u2014 equivalently, the complement subset (numbers *not* chosen) must sum to 82 \u2212 51 = 31.\n\nSo now, find a subset that sums to 31 (easier to check smaller sums), or directly find one that sums to 51.\n\nLet\u2019s try combinations.\n\nLargest number is 22.

Now need 13 \u2014 and 13 is in the list! So candidate: 22 + 16 + 13 = 51. Check availability: numbers include 13, 16, and 22 \u2014 yes, all present once.
