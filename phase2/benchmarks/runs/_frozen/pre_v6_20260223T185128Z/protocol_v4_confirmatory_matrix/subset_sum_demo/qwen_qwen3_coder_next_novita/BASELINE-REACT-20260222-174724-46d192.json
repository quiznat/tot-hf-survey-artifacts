    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers [7, 16, 19, 20, 24] and a target 79. We need to combine these numbers (using arithmetic operations, likely addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and possibly concatenation or exponentiation \u2014 but since no tools are available, and standard 24-game style rules apply unless specified) to reach exactly 79. Since no operations are specified, and no tools, this is likely a puzzle where we can use any standard arithmetic operations, possibly using each number exactly once.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations.\n\nFirst, sum all numbers: 7 + 16 + 19 + 20 + 24 = 86.

Let\u2019s compute the total sum: 7 + 16 + 19 + 20 + 24 = 86. Target is 79, which is 7 less than 86.

So that sum is 79 without the 7, which is invalid.
