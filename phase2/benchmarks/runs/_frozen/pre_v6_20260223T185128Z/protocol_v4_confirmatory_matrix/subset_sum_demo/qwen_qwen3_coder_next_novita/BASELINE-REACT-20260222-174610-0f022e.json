The task likely requires using *all* numbers exactly once (standard in such puzzles unless stated otherwise). So we need an expression using all five numbers [4, 11, 18, 22, 24] to reach 61.\n\nLet\u2019s try other combinations.\n\nTotal sum = 79. We need to reduce by 79 \u2212 61 = 18.

Need 15 more from [4, 11, 18]. 18 \u2212 4 = 14, 14 + 11 = 25 \u2192 too much. 11 + 4 = 15! So 24 + 22 + 11 + 4 = 61, but again 18 is unused.\n\nWe *must* use all five numbers. So perhaps use 18 in a neutral way \u2014 e.g., multiply by 1 or add/subtract 0.\n\nCan we make 1 from two numbers? e.g., 22 \u00f7 22 = 1",
