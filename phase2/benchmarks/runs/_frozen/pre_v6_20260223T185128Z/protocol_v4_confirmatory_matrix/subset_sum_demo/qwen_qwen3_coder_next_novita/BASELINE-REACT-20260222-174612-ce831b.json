Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning problem.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a subset that sums to 48.\n\nFirst, check if any single number equals 48 \u2014 no.\n\nCheck pairs:\n- 25 + 24 = 49 \u2192 too high\n- 25 + 19 = 44 \u2192 need 4 more, but 4 not in list\n- 25 + 16 = 41 \u2192 need 7 \u2192 not available\n- 25 + 15 = 40 \u2192 need 8 \u2192",

Yes \u2014 all numbers are in the input list: 8, 15, and 25 are present. So the subset {8, 15, 25} sums to 48. We have found a solution.",
