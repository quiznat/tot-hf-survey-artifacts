From STEP 1, we considered 25 + 20 = 45, and need to subtract 6. We noted that 12 / 2 = 6, and we have two 2s, so we can use one 2 for division and still have another 2 left. But we must use *all* numbers? The task doesn\u2019t explicitly state we must use all numbers \u2014 but in typical \"make the target\" puzzles (like Countdown or 24 game), usually all numbers must be used exactly once.
