If we subtract 5, we get 40: 22 + 23 \u2212 5 = 40. That uses 22, 23, and 5 \u2014 but we still have [2, 2, 10] left unused. Usually, in",

My earlier attempt (22 + 23 \u2212 5 = 40) uses only three numbers and leaves 2, 2, 10 unused \u2014 which is invalid unless the task allows using a subset.

Let\u2019s try to leverage the near-sum 22 + 23 = 45, which is 5 more than 40 \u2014 and we *do* have a 5! So 22 + 23 \u2212 5 = 40, but that leaves 2, 2, 10 unused. To incorporate them, we could try to make the extra numbers cancel out (e.g., + (10 \u2212 10), but we only have one 10). Alternatively, maybe multiply something by 1 (e.g., \u00d7 (2/2) = 1) to preserve value while using both 2s.\n\nIdea: (22 + 23 \u2212 5) \u00d7",

To incorporate them without changing the value, we can multiply by 1 or add 0. For example, (2/2) = 1, so multiplying the whole expression by (2/2) would keep it at 40, but then we still have 10 left. Alternatively, we could do something like: (22 + 23 \u2212 5) + (2 \u2212 2) \u00d7 10 = 40 + 0 \u00d7 10 = 40. That uses all numbers: 22, 2",
