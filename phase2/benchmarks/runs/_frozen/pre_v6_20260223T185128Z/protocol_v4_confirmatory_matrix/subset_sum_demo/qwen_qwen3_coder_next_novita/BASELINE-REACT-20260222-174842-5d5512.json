Remaining: 4, 13, 18. Can we make 16? 18 - 4 = 14, 13 + 4 = 17 \u2014 not 16. 18 - 13 + 4 = 9. No.",

Remaining numbers: 18, 19, 21 \u2014 too big to add just 4.\n\nWhat about 21 + 18 = 39 \u2192 need 17 more. Remaining: 4, 13, 19. 13 + 4 = 17! Yes! So 21 + 18 + 13 + 4 = 56. Let's verify: 21 + 18 = 39, 39 + 13 = 52, 52 + 4 = 56. That uses 21, 18, 13, 4 \u2014 all in the",

All numbers used are from the list [4, 13, 18, 19, 21], and we didn't need to use 19 \u2014 but the task doesn't require using *all* numbers, just reaching the target using some of them with arithmetic operations.
