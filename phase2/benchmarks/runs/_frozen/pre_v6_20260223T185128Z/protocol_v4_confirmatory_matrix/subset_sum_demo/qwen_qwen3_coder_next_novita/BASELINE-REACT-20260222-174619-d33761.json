    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [5, 17, 17, 18, 20, 24] and a target sum of 76.

Since no tools are available, this is a reasoning-only task.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the total sum first:  \n5 + 17 + 17 + 18 + 20 + 24 =  \n5 + 17 = 22  \n22 + 17 = 39  \n39 + 18 = 57  \n57 + 20 = 77  \n77 + 24 = 101  \n\nTotal sum = 101.

Let\u2019s find a subset that sums to 25.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- 5 + 20 = 25 \u2192 yes! That works.\nSo if we exclude 5 and 20, the remaining numbers are [17, 17, 18, 24].
