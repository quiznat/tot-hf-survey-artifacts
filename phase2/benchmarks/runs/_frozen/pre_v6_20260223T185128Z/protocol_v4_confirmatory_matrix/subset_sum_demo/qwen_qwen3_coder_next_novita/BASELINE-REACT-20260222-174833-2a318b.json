    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We need to find a way to reach the target number 52 using the numbers [3, 10, 14, 15, 25] with basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses). Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning problem.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations:\n\nStart by checking sums:\n- 25 + 15 = 40 \u2192 52 - 40 = 12 \u2192 need 12 from [3,10,14] \u2192 10 + 3 = 13 (too big), 14 - 3 = 11, 10 + 14 = 24 \u2014 no.\n- 25 + 14 = 39 \u2192 52 - 39 = 13 \u2192 need 13 from [3,10",

We still have 15 unused, but the task likely allows using a subset of the numbers (standard 24-game style). Let's verify: 25 + 14 + 10 + 3 = 52. Yes! All numbers used? Wait \u2014 we have five numbers: [3, 10, 14, 15, 25]. We used four. If all must be used, we need to incorporate 15 in a neutral way (e.g., \u00d71 or +0). Can we make 1 from 15 and something? 1",

If the task requires using *all* numbers exactly once (as in classic 24-game), we need to incorporate 15 in a neutral way \u2014 e.g., multiply by (15/15) = 1, or add (15\u221215)=0. But we only have one 15, so we can\u2019t do 15/15. Alternative: adjust the sum to include 15 via subtraction/addition with other numbers.\n\nLet\u2019s try: (25 + 15) = 40; (14 + 10) = 24; 40 + 24 = 64 \u2192 too big. 64 \u2212 15 = 49 (but 15 already",
