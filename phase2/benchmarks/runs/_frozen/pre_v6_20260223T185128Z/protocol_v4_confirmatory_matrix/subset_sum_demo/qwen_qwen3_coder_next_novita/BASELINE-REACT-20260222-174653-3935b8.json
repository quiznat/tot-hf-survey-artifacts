This is a classic \"make target\" puzzle.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations:\n\nWe want to use some subset of the numbers (likely each at most once) with operations to get 60.\n\nFirst, check if any single number equals 60 \u2014 no.\n\nCheck sums:\n- 5 + 7 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 20 + 23 = 98 \u2192 too big.\n- Try subsets:\n  - 20 + 23 = 43; 60 \u2212 4",

That\u2019s exactly the target.\n- All numbers are distinct and 5 and 12 are both in the list.\n\nSo, 5 \u00d7 12 = 60 uses two numbers from the list and achieves the target.\n\nNo need for more numbers or operations \u2014 this is a valid solution.\n\nFINAL: 5 \u00d7 12 = 60"
