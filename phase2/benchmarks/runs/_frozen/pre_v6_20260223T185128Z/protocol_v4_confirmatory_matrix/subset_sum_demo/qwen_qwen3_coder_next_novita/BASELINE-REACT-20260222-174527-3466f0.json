    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24] and a target: 62. We need to find a combination (likely using arithmetic operations) that yields 62. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning puzzle \u2014 possibly using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, concatenation, or exponentiation, but typically in such benchmarks, only basic arithmetic (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7) and parentheses are allowed.\n\nLet\u2019s explore sums first:\n- Sum of all numbers: 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 = 86 \u2192 too high.\n- Try subsets:\n  - 24 + 22 = 46; 62 \u2212 46 = 16 \u2192 do we have 16?

That uses numbers 2, 14, 22, 24 \u2014 all in the list. Remaining numbers (6, 18) are unused, but the task likely allows using a subset (common in such puzzles unless \"use all numbers\" is specified).

All numbers used are from the input list, and the arithmetic checks out. This is a valid solution. No further reasoning needed \u2014 we can now output the answer.",
