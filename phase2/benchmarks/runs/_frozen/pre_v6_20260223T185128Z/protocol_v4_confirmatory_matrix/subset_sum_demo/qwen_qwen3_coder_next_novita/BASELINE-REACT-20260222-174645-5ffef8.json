    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers [1, 14, 14, 16, 17] and a target of 61. We need to combine these numbers (likely using arithmetic operations) to reach the target. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning problem \u2014 possibly using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, concatenation, or exponentiation, but typically in such puzzles only basic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) are allowed, and each number may be used exactly once.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations.\n\nFirst, sum all numbers: 1 + 14 + 14 + 16 + 17 = 62 \u2014 close to 61, just 1 over.\n\nSo 62 \u2212 1 = 61, but we already used the 1 in the sum. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we do: 1",

Let's compute: 14+14=28, +16=44, +17=61, then 61 \u2212 1 = 60 \u2014 no, that's wrong. Wait: 14+14+16+17 = 61 exactly! Then where does the 1 go?

Another idea: use subtraction with one of the 14s: e.g., 14 + 14 + 16 + 17 = 61, so if we do (14 + 14 + 16 + 17) \u00d7 1 = 61, that uses all numbers!
