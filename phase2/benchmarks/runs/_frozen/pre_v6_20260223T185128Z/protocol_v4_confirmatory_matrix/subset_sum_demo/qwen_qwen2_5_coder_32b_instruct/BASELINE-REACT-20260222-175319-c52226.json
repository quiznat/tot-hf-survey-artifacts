    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find if there's a combination of numbers from the given list that sum up to the target value of 17. Since no tools are available, I'll have to work through this manually by checking different combinations.\n\nLet me examine the numbers: [1, 5, 8, 16, 21, 22, 23] and target: 17\n\nI'll start by looking for pairs that might work:\n- 1 + 16 = 17 \u2713\n\nThis works! I found a combination of numbers that sum to the target.\n\nFINAL: 17 can be achieved by adding 1 and 16 from the given list."
