    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a way to combine the numbers [5, 5, 7, 7, 10] to get the target value 29. Since no tools are available, I'll need to work through this mathematically.\n\nLet me consider different combinations of these numbers:\n- I have two 5's and two 7's, plus one 10\n- The sum of all numbers is 5+5+7+7+10 = 34\n- I need to find which numbers to use or how to combine them to get 29\n\nSince 34 - 29 = 5, I could try removing one 5 from the total sum.\nAlternatively, I could look for other combinations.\n\nLet me think systematically:\n- 5 + 5 + 7 + 7 + 10 = 34 (too high by 5)\n-",

This means I need to either:\n1. Remove one 5 (so I use 5, 7, 7, 10 instead of 5, 5, 7, 7, 10)\n2. Find another combination that sums to 29\n\nLet me check option 1: 5 + 7 + 7 + 10 = 29 \u2713\n\nThis works! I can use one 5, two 7's, and one 10 to get exactly 29.\n\nFINAL: 5 + 7 +"
