    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a combination of numbers from the given list that sum to the target value of 53. Let me analyze the numbers: [2, 7, 11, 16, 21, 22, 23, 25]. \n\nSince this is a subset sum problem, I should look for combinations that add up to 53. Let me start by checking if any single number equals 53 - but none do.\n\nLet me try combinations systematically:\n- The largest numbers are 25, 23, 22, 21\n- 25 + 23 = 48, need 5 more\n- 25 + 22 = 47, need 6 more  \n- 25 + 21 = 46, need 7 more\n- 23 + 22 =",

So 25 + 21 + 7 = 53 \u2713\n\nLet me verify: 25 + 21 + 7 = 46 + 7 = 53 \u2713\n\nThis uses three numbers: 25, 21, and 7.\n\nACTION: FINAL: [25, 21, 7]"
