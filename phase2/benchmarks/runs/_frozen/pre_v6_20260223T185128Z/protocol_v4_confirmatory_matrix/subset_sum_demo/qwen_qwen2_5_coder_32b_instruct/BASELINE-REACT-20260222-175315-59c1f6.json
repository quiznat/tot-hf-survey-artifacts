Since no tools are available, I'll need to work through this manually by trying different combinations of operations.\n\nLet me start by examining what operations might work:\n- The numbers are: 2, 2, 5, 12, 20, 25\n- Target is 39\n\nI should look for combinations that could work. Let me try some approaches:\n\nFirst, let me see if I can use addition and subtraction effectively:\n- 25 + 12 = 37, which is close to 39\n- 37 + 5 = 42, too big\n- 37 + 2 = 39, but I still",
