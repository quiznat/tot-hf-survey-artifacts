    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a combination of numbers from the given list that sum to the target value of 38. The numbers available are [3, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 22]. Since no tools are available, I'll need to work through this manually by trying different combinations.\n\nLet me start by looking for obvious combinations or patterns:\n- 22 + 17 = 39 (close to 38, just 1 too much)\n- 22 + 18 = 40 (2 too much)\n- 18 + 17 = 35 (3 short)\n\nLet me try combinations with three numbers:\n- 22 + 17 + 3 = 42 (4 too much)\n- 22 + 18 - 3 = 37 (1 short)\n- 2",

I need to add 1 more to get to 38. But I can't use 3 again since it's already used.\n\nLet me try other combinations:\n- 22 + 17 + 6 - 7 = 38 (22 + 17 = 39, then 39 + 6 = 45, then 45 - 7 = 38) \u2713\n\nLet me verify: 22 + 17 + 6 - 7 = 39 + 6 - 7 = 45 - 7 = 38 \u2713\n\nThis works!
