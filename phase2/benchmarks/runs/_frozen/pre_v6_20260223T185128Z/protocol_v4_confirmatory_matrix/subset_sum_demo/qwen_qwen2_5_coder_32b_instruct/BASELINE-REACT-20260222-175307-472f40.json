    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a way to combine the given numbers [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24] to reach the target value 62. Since no tools are available, I'll need to use mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on these numbers.\n\nLet me try different combinations systematically:\n\nFirst, let me see what happens if I add all the numbers:\n2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 = 86\n\nThis is too large, so I need to either subtract some numbers or find a different combination.\n\nLet me try subtracting some numbers from the total:\n86 - 24 = 62\n\nThat works! So I can get 62 by adding all numbers except 24.\n\nLet me verify: 2 + 6 + 14 +",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me continue my systematic approach to solve this problem.\n\nI already found that 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 = 86, and 86 - 24 = 62. This means I can achieve the target by adding all numbers except 24.\n\nLet me double-check this:\n2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 = 62\nThis is correct!\n\nSo the solution is to add the numbers 2, 6, 14, 18, and 22, while excluding 24.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as: (2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24) - 24 = 62\n\nFINAL: The target 62 can be achieved by adding the numbers"
