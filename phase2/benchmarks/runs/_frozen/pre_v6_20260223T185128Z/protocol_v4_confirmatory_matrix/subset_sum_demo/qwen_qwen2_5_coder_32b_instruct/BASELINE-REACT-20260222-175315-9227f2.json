This is essentially a subset sum problem where I need to identify which numbers to include to reach exactly 50.\n\nLet me try different combinations systematically:\n\nFirst, let me see if any single number equals 50: None of the numbers are 50.\n\nLet me try pairs:\n- 2 + 10 = 12 (too small)\n- 2 + 18 = 20 (too small)\n- 2 + 19 = 21 (too small)\n- 2 + 22 = 24 (too small)\n- 2 + 24 = 26 (too small)",
