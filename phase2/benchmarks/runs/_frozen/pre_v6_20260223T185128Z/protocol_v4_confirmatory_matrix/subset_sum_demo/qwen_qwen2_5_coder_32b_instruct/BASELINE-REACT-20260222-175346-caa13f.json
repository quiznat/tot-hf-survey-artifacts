    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a combination of numbers from the given list that sum to the target value of 29. The numbers available are [1, 3, 4, 11, 21, 21]. Let me think through possible combinations systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll look for obvious combinations:\n- 21 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 29 (this works!)\n- 21 + 11 - 3 = 29 (but this uses subtraction, which isn't allowed)\n- 21 + 21 - 11 - 4 + 3 - 1 = 29 (this is too complex and might not be what's intended)\n\nLet me verify: 21 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 29\n- 21 + 4 = 25\n- 25 +",

I claimed that 21 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 29, but I need to check if this actually equals 29:\n\n21 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 25 + 3 + 1 = 28 + 1 = 29\n\nYes, that's correct. However, I should also consider if there are other valid combinations or if I've missed something.\n\nLooking at the numbers [1, 3, 4, 11, 21, 21] again:\n- I could use 21 + 21 = 42, which is too large\n- I could use 21 + 11 = 32, leaving 32 - 29 = 3, so I'd need to subtract 3, but that's not allowed",
