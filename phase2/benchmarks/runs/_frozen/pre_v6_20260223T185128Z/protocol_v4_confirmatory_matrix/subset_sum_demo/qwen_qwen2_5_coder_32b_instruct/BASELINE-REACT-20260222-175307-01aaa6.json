    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a way to combine the given numbers [2, 3, 4, 9, 21] using basic arithmetic operations to reach the target value 37. Since no tools are available, I'll need to work through this manually by trying different combinations of operations.\n\nLet me start by examining what operations might work:\n- The largest number is 21, so I need to get the remaining sum (37-21=16) from [2, 3, 4, 9]\n- Or I could try other combinations like using multiplication or division\n\nLet me try: 21 + 9 + 4 + 3 = 37\nThat's 21 + 9 + 4 + 3 = 37\nChecking: 21 + 9 = 30, then 30 + 4 = 34,",

I used addition with four of the five available numbers (21, 9, 4, 3). I didn't use the number 2 in this combination.\n\nLet me double-check that I'm using valid operations and that all numbers are used appropriately:\n- All numbers are used exactly once (2 is not used, but that's allowed since we're looking for any combination that reaches the target)\n- Only basic arithmetic operations are used (addition)\n- The result equals the target: 37\n\nFINAL: 21 + 9 +"
