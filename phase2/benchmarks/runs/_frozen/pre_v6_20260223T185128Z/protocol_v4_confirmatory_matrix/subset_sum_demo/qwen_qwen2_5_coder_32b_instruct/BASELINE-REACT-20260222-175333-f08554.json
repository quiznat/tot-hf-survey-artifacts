    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a subset of the given numbers that sum to the target value of 60. The numbers available are [5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 20, 23]. This is a subset sum problem where I need to determine which combination of these numbers adds up to exactly 60.\n\nLet me work through this systematically by trying different combinations:\n\nFirst, let me see what happens if I try to use the largest numbers:\n- 23 + 20 = 43, need 17 more\n- 23 + 12 = 35, need 25 more\n- 20 + 12 = 32, need 28 more\n\nLet me try combinations with 23 (the largest):\n- 23 + 20 + 12 = 55, need",

Let me check: 20 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 7 = 60 \u2713\n\nSo I have at least two valid solutions:\n1. {23, 20, 12, 5} \n2. {20, 12, 11, 10, 7}\n\nSince the problem asks for \"a\" subset that sums to the target, either solution is acceptable.
