    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a combination of numbers from the given list that sum to the target value of 51. Let me analyze the numbers: [1, 2, 9, 11, 11, 20, 22, 23]. \n\nI should look for combinations systematically. Since we have 8 numbers, there are many possible combinations, but I'll try to be strategic.\n\nLet me start by looking at larger numbers since they get us closer to 51 faster:\n- 23 + 22 = 45, need 6 more\n- 23 + 20 = 43, need 8 more  \n- 22 + 20 = 42, need 9 more\n\nLet me try 23 + 22 + 9 = 54, which is too big by 3\nLet me try",
