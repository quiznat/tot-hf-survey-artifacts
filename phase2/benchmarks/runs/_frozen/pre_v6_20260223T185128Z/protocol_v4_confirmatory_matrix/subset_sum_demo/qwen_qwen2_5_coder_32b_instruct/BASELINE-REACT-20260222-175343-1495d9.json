Since no tools are available, I'll need to work through this mathematically.\n\nLet me consider different combinations:\n- The numbers are: 1, 1, 10, 12, 19, 19\n- Target: 33\n\nI should look for combinations that sum to 33. Let me try various approaches:\n\nFirst, let me see what happens if I add some of the larger numbers:\n- 19 + 12 = 31, which is close to 33\n- 19 + 10 = 29, which is also close\n- 12 + 10 = 22, which is smaller",
