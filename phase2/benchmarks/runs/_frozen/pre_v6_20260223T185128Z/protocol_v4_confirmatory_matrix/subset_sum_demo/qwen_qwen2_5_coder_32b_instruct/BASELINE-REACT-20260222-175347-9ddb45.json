Since no tools are available, I'll need to work through this manually by trying different combinations of operations.\n\nLet me start by examining what numbers I have and what operations might work:\n- Numbers: 4, 4, 12, 16, 23, 24\n- Target: 36\n\nI should look for combinations that could work. Let me try some approaches:\n\nFirst, let me see if I can use addition and subtraction effectively:\n- 24 + 12 = 36, but I still have other numbers (4, 4, 16, 23) left\n- Maybe I can make the remaining numbers equal zero or",
