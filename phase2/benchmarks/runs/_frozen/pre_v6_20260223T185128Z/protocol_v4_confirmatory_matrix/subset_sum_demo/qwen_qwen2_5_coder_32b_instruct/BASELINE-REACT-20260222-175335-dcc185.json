Since I don't have any specific tools available, I'll need to think through this mathematically.\n\nLet me consider different combinations:\n- I could try adding some numbers and subtracting others\n- I could look for patterns or simple arithmetic operations\n\nLooking at the numbers: 1, 8, 18, 18, 18, 23\nThe target is 19.\n\nLet me see if I can use basic arithmetic operations:\n- 23 - 18 = 5, then 5 + 8 + 1 = 14 (too small)\n- 18 + 1 = 19, but I still have other numbers unused\n-",

I need to use the given numbers [1, 8, 18, 18, 18, 23] to make 19. \n\nLooking more carefully:\n- If I use 18 + 1 = 19, that works perfectly! \n- This uses exactly two numbers: 18 and 1\n- The remaining numbers (8, 18, 18, 23) are not needed\n\nThis is a valid solution since I'm combining the numbers using basic arithmetic operations to reach the target.\n\nFINAL: 18 + 1 = 19"
