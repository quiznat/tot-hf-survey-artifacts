    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a way to combine the given numbers [2, 6, 7, 21, 23, 24] using basic arithmetic operations to reach the target value 39. Since no tools are available, I'll need to work through this manually by trying different combinations of operations.\n\nLet me start by examining what numbers might be useful:\n- 21 and 24 are relatively large numbers that are close to the target\n- 23 is also close to the target\n- 2, 6, and 7 are smaller numbers that could be used for adjustment\n\nLet me try some combinations systematically:\n\nFirst, let's see if I can use 21 + 24 = 45, which is 6 more than 39. So I'd need to subtract 6, but I have 6 as one of my numbers. That would give me",
