    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about forming the largest possible number from the given digits that is divisible by the provided divisor (7) and does not exceed the oracle_max value (8806). I'll start by trying to form the largest number from the digits and then check if it meets the criteria.\n\nACTION: None None\n\nTHINK: The digits provided are 0, 6, 8, 8. Forming the largest number possible with these digits would give us 8860. However, this number must also be divisible by 7 and less than or equal to 8806. Let's check if 8860 meets the divisibility condition first, and if not, we will try the next possible largest combination that might meet all conditions.\n\nTHINK: 8860 is not divisible by 7. The next step is to try the next possible largest number which could be",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there are no tools available, I need to manually determine the largest number formed from the digits [0, 6, 8, 8] that is divisible by 7 and does not exceed 8806. The largest number formed from these digits is 8860, but it exceeds the limit and is not divisible by 7. Therefore, I should consider the next largest possible numbers, such as 8806, 8680, etc., and check each for divisibility by 7 and compliance with the maximum limit.\n\nTHINK: Checking 8806 first since it is the closest to the upper limit and can potentially be the answer.\n8806 % 7 = 0, so 8806 is divisible by 7 and within the limit.\n\nFINAL: 8806"
