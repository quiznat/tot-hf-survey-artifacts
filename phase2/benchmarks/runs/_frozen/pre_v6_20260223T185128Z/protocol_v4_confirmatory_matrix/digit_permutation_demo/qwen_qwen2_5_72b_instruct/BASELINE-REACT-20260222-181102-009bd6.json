    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is not explicitly stated, but given the inputs, it seems like we need to find a combination of the digits that, when concatenated and interpreted as an integer, is divisible by the given divisor (8) and does not exceed the oracle_max value (4512). We can start by trying to form numbers from the digits provided, ensuring they do not exceed 4512 and check their divisibility by 8.\n\nACTION: None available, so I will proceed with reasoning and calculation.\n\nTHINK: Let's try forming numbers from the smallest to the largest possible, checking each for divisibility by 8 and compliance with the maximum limit.\n\n- Forming all combinations of the digits [5, 4, 1, 2]:\n  - Single digits: 5, 4, 1, 2 (all less than 4512)\n  - Two-digit combinations: 54",
