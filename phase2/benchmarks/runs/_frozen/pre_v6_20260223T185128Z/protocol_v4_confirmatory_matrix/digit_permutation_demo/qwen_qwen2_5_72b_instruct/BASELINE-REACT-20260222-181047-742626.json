    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is not clearly defined in terms of what the expected output should be. However, given the inputs (a list of digits and a divisor) and the context of a benchmark task, it seems like I need to create the largest possible number from the digits that is divisible by the divisor and does not exceed the oracle_max value. Let's start by generating all permutations of the digits and then check for divisibility and the max constraint.\n\nACTION: GeneratePermutations [8, 7, 0, 4] \n\n(Note: Since no actual tool is provided, this is a conceptual action to guide the next step.)\n\nTHINK: Without an actual tool to generate permutations, I will manually consider the permutations and apply the conditions.\n\nTHINK: First, let's sort the digits in descending order to start with the largest possible numbers: [8, 7, 4, 0].\n\nTHINK: We can form the following",
