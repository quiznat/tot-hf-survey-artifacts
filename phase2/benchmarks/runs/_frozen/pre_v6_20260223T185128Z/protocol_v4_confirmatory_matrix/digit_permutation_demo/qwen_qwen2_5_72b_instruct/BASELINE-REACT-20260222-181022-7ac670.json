    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to determine if the number formed by the given digits is divisible by the given divisor. The digits are [4, 2, 2, 4] and the divisor is 11. The maximum number that can be formed with these digits is 4422, as given by the oracle_max. I will check if 4422 is divisible by 11.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: To check if 4422 is divisible by 11, I can use the divisibility rule for 11, which is to find the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions, and see if that difference is divisible by 11.\n\nTHINK: For the number 4422, the sum of the digits in the odd positions (4 + 2) is 6, and the",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the action step. Since we don't have any tools available, I'll proceed directly with the reasoning.\n\nTHINK: For the number 4422, the sum of the digits in the odd positions (4 + 2) is 6, and the sum of the digits in the even positions (4 + 2) is also 6. The difference between these sums is 6 - 6 = 0. Since 0 is divisible by 11, 4422 is divisible by 11.\n\nFINAL: Yes, 4422 is divisible by 11."
