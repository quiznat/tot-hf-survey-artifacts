    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is not clearly defined in terms of what needs to be done with the digits and the divisor. However, given the context of a benchmark task and the presence of a 'divisor', it's likely that I need to form a number from the provided digits that is divisible by the given divisor (4 in this case). The number should also not exceed the 'oracle_max' value (6560).\n\nACTION: I will attempt to form the largest possible number from the digits [0, 5, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4 and does not exceed 6560.\n\nTHINK: To form the largest number, I should try placing the highest digits at the most significant places. However, since the number must be divisible by 4, I need to ensure that the last two digits of the number form a number that is divisible by 4. Let's consider the permutations of the",

I will proceed with forming the largest number from the digits [0, 5, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4 and does not exceed 6560, using only logical reasoning.\n\nTo ensure the number is divisible by 4, the last two digits of the number must form a number that is divisible by 4. Let's list the possible combinations of the last two digits from [0, 5, 6, 6] and check which ones are divisible by 4:\n\n- 05 (not divisible by 4)\n- 06 (divisible by 4)\n- 50 (divisible by 4)\n- 56 (divisible by 4)\n- 60 (divisible by 4)\n- 65 (not divisible by 4)\n- 66",
