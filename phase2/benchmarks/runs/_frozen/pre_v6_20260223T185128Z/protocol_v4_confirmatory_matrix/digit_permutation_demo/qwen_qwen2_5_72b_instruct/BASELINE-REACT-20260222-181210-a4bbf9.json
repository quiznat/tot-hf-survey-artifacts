    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about creating the largest possible number from the given digits that is divisible by the given divisor and does not exceed the maximum value provided by the oracle. I will start by generating all permutations of the digits and then filter out the numbers that meet the criteria.\n\nACTION: None, as there are no external tools available, I will proceed with reasoning and computation.\n\nTHINK: Since I cannot use any tools, I will manually generate permutations of the digits [4, 4, 5, 9] and check each permutation to see if it is divisible by 4 and less than or equal to 9544. I will start with the largest possible permutations and work my way down to ensure I find the largest valid number first.\n\nTHINK: The largest possible number formed by the digits is 9544. Let's check if this number is divisible by 4.\n\nTHINK: 95",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None,'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It appears there was an error in the format of my previous action. Since there are no tools available, I'll directly compute the solution through reasoning.\n\nTHINK: The largest number formed by the digits [4, 4, 5, 9] is 9544. Let's check if 9544 is divisible by 4 and does not exceed 9544.\n\nTHINK: A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. The last two digits of 9544 are 44, which is divisible by 4 (44 \u00f7 4 = 11). Therefore, 9544 is divisible by 4.\n\nFINAL: 9544"
