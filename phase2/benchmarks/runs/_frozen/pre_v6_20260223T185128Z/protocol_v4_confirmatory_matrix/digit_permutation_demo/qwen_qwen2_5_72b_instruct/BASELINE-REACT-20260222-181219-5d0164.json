    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to determine if the number represented by the digits can be divided by the divisor without any remainder. The digits provided are [1, 2, 0, 0], which form the number 1200. I need to check if 1200 is divisible by 8. If it is, the answer will be \"Yes\", otherwise, it will be \"No\". Since there are no tools available, I will perform the calculation directly.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: 1200 divided by 8 equals 150, which means there is no remainder. Therefore, 1200 is divisible by 8.\n\nFINAL: Yes",
