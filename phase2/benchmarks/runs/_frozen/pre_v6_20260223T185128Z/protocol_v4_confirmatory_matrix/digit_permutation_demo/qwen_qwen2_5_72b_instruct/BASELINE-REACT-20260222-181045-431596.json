    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve performing some arithmetic or logical operation with the given digits and divisor while considering the upper limit oracle_max. I need to determine what specific operation is required based on the given inputs.\n\nACTION: None None\n\nTHINK: Since no specific tools are available and the action was not applicable, I will proceed with reasoning. Given the list of digits [2, 5, 7, 6] and a divisor of 4, along with an upper limit of 7652, a likely task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits that is divisible by the divisor and does not exceed the oracle_max.\n\nTHINK: To solve this, I will generate all possible permutations of the digits, convert them to integers, and then check which ones are divisible by 4 and do not exceed 7652. From these, I will select the largest number.\n\nFINAL: 7",
