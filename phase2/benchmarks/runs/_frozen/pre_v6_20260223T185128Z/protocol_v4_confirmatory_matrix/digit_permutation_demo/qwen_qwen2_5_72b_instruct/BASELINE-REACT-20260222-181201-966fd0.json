    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task appears to require finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the given divisor. The digits provided are [9, 6, 2, 7] and the divisor is 4. The oracle_max value (9672) might be a hint or a target to achieve. Since no tools are available, I need to solve this problem through logical steps.\n\nFirst, I should generate all possible permutations of the digits and then check each permutation to see if it is divisible by 4. If multiple numbers are divisible by 4, I should select the largest one.\n\nACTION: None, as there are no tools to use, I will proceed with logical steps to find the solution.\n\nTHINK: To efficiently find the largest number divisible by 4, I can start by checking the divisibility rule for 4, which states that a number is divisible by 4 if the last",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: To efficiently find the largest number divisible by 4, I can start by checking the divisibility rule for 4, which states that a number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. Given the digits [9, 6, 2, 7], I should generate all possible two-digit combinations and check their divisibility by 4. Once I have the valid endings, I will try to form the largest possible number using these endings.\n\nLet's list all two-digit combinations and check for divisibility by 4:\n- 96, 69, 62, 26, 27, 72, 92, 79\n\nNow I will filter out the combinations that are divisible by 4.\nFINAL: After filtering, the valid two-digit endings that are divisible by 4 are 96, 72,"
