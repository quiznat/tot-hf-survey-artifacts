    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve performing some kind of operation on the digits provided in the list [3, 6, 2, 4] with a divisor of 7 and an upper limit defined by 'oracle_max' which is 6342. A common task involving digits and a divisor could be finding a number formed by these digits that is divisible by the divisor and is less than or equal to the 'oracle_max'. Since no specific tools are available, I will need to form a number from the digits and check if it meets the criteria.\n\nACTION: Form a number from the given digits and check if it is divisible by 7 and does not exceed 6342. To maximize the chance of success, let's start by trying to form the largest possible number from the digits that might still be within the limit and check its divisibility.\n\nTHINK: To form the largest number from the digits, we can",

To form the largest possible number from the digits [3, 6, 2, 4] that is less than or equal to 6342 and check if it is divisible by 7, I will first sort the digits in descending order and then form the number.
