    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task appears to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the digits provided, which is also divisible by the given divisor, and does not exceed the maximum value specified by the oracle. I need to generate numbers using the digits [2, 2, 0, 6] and check if they are divisible by 7 and do not exceed 6202. Since there are no tools available, I will have to manually try different permutations of the digits.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: To start, I should consider the highest possible numbers first as we are looking for the largest number that meets the criteria. The digits can form several numbers, but since we want the largest number, let's try forming the largest possible 4-digit number first and then check downwards if it doesn't work. The largest permutation of [2, 2, 0, 6] is 6220.",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the format of the response. I'll proceed with the reasoning without specifying an action, as there are no tools to use. Let's verify if 6220 is divisible by 7 and does not exceed 6202.\n\nTHINK: 6220 is greater than 6202, so it cannot be the answer. Next, I will check the next largest permutation of the digits [2, 2, 0, 6] which is 6202.\n\nTHINK: 6202 is within the limit set by the oracle. Now, I need to check if 6202 is divisible by 7.\n\nFINAL: 6202 is divisible by 7, and it is the largest number that can be formed from the digits [2, 2, 0, 6] without exceeding the oracle"
