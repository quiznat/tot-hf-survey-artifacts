    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the given digits [0, 8, 0, 3] which is divisible by the given divisor 5, and is less than or equal to the oracle_max 8300. A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Since we only have the digits 0, 8, 0, and 3, the number must end in 0 to be divisible by 5. I will try to form the largest possible number that ends in 0 and is less than or equal to 8300.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: To form the largest number, I should place the largest digit in the highest place value, followed by the next largest, and so on, ensuring the number ends in 0. The digits available are 0, 8, 0, and",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: To proceed correctly, I realize there was an oversight in my action statement. Since no tools are available, all steps should be considered within the THINK and FINAL actions. Let me reassess and directly form the solution.\n\nTHINK: Given the digits [0, 8, 0, 3], I need to form the largest number that is divisible by 5 and does not exceed 8300. For a number to be divisible by 5, it must end in 0 or 5. Since 5 is not among the digits, the number must end in 0. The remaining digits are 8 and 3, with 0 being repeated. Placing the digits in descending order while ensuring the last digit is 0, we get 8300. This number does not exceed 8300 and meets all criteria.\n\nFINAL: 8300"
