    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about forming numbers from the given digits that are divisible by the provided divisor (5 in this case). The goal is to find the largest possible number under the constraint that it should not exceed the oracle_max value (2115). Since there are no tools available, I will proceed with logical reasoning and computation.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: To form numbers divisible by 5, they must end in 0 or 5. Given the digits [2, 1, 1, 5], the only option for the last digit is 5. Now, I need to arrange the remaining digits [2, 1, 1] in descending order to form the largest possible number that does not exceed 2115.\n\nTHINK: Arranging the digits [2, 1, 1] in descending order gives 211. Therefore, the largest number that can be",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous step. Since no tools are available, the action \"None\" is not necessary. I will continue with the reasoning directly.\n\nTHINK: To form numbers divisible by 5, they must end in 0 or 5. Given the digits [2, 1, 1, 5], the only option for the last digit is 5. Now, I need to arrange the remaining digits [2, 1, 1] in descending order to form the largest possible number that does not exceed 2115.\n\nTHINK: Arranging the digits [2, 1, 1] in descending order gives 211. Therefore, the largest number that can be formed by appending 5 at the end is 2115. This number is within the constraint of 2115.\n\nFINAL: 2115"
