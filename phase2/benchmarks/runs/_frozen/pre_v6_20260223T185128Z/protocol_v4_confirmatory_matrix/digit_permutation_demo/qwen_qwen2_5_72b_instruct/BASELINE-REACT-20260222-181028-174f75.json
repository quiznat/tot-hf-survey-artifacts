    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, we need to find the largest number that can be formed from the given digits such that it is divisible by the given divisor (6 in this case). The number must also not exceed the oracle_max value provided (9318 in this case).\n\nTo form the largest number divisible by 6, we need to ensure two conditions:\n1. The number should be even (last digit should be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).\n2. The sum of the digits should be divisible by 3.\n\nGiven digits: [9, 1, 3, 8]\nOracle max: 9318\n\nLet's start by generating all possible permutations of the digits and check which ones meet the criteria.\nACTION: PERMUTE [9, 1, 3, 8]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since we don't have a tool to generate permutations, we will need to manually consider all possible combinations of the digits to form numbers and then check if they meet the criteria for divisibility by 6 and do not exceed the oracle_max value.\n\nLet's list out all the possible numbers that can be formed from the digits [9, 1, 3, 8] and are less than or equal to 9318.\n\nPossible numbers (in descending order):\n- 9831 (exceeds 9318, so not considered)\n- 9813 (exceeds 9318, so not considered)\n- 9381 (exceeds 9318, so not considered)\n- 9318 (within limit, check divisibility)\n- 9183 (exceeds 9318, so not considered",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Continuing from the previous thought, let's evaluate the remaining possibilities:\n\n- 9318: This number is within the limit. Let's check its divisibility by 6:\n  - It is even (last digit is 8).\n  - Sum of digits: 9 + 3 + 1 + 8 = 21, which is divisible by 3.\n  - Therefore, 9318 is divisible by 6.\n\nSince 9318 meets all the criteria, it is the largest number that can be formed from the given digits and is divisible by 6 without exceeding the oracle_max value.\n\nFINAL: 9318"
