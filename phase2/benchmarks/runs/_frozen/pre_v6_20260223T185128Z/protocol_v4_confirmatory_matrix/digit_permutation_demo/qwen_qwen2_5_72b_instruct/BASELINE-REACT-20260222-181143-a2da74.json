    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve manipulating the given digits to form a number that is divisible by the provided divisor (4 in this case) and is less than or equal to the oracle_max value (5540). Since no tools are available, I will use logical reasoning to solve this.\n\nTHINK: To form a number divisible by 4, the last two digits of the number must be divisible by 4. The digits available are [4, 5, 5, 0]. Let's consider all possible combinations of the last two digits and check their divisibility by 4.\n\nTHINK: Possible combinations for the last two digits:\n- 40 (divisible by 4)\n- 50 (not divisible by 4)\n- 54 (not divisible by 4)\n- 04 (divisible by 4)\n\nTHINK: The valid combinations for the last two digits are 4",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing from the previous step, the valid combinations for the last two digits that are divisible by 4 are 40 and 04. Now, we need to form the largest possible number using the remaining digits (5, 5) and placing them before the valid combinations, ensuring the number does not exceed 5540.\n\nTHINK: Forming numbers:\n- With 40 as the last two digits: 5540\n- With 04 as the last two digits: Not possible as it would require leading zeros which are not allowed, and 5504 is also a valid option but larger than 5540.\n\nTHINK: The number 5540 is the largest possible number formed with the given digits that is divisible by 4 and does not exceed the oracle_max value of 5540.\n\nFINAL: 5540"
