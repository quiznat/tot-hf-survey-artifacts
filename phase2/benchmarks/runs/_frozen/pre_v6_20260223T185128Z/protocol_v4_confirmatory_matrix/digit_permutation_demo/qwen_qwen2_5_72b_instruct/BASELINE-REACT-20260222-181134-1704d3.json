    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve processing a list of digits and a divisor. Without specific instructions in the task input, a common operation could be to form numbers from the digits and then check their divisibility by the given divisor. Since the maximum value for the oracle is provided, it could be used as an upper limit for any generated number. Let's try forming a number from the digits and check if it's divisible by the divisor.\n\nACTION: None available, so I will proceed with logical steps.\n\nTHINK: Given the digits [0, 9, 0, 9], we can form numbers like 9090, 9900, etc. We need to check which of these numbers (if any) are divisible by 5 and do not exceed the oracle_max value of 9900. Numbers divisible by 5 end in 0 or 5, and since our digits include 0 and",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there are no tools available, I will manually form numbers from the digits [0, 9, 0, 9] that are less than or equal to 9900 and check their divisibility by 5. Numbers divisible by 5 must end in 0 or 5. Given the digits, the only possible ending digit is 0. Let's form the largest possible number ending in 0 that does not exceed 9900.\n\nTHINK: The digits can form the number 9900, which is within the allowed range and ends in 0. Let's check if 9900 is divisible by 5.\n\nFINAL: 9900 is divisible by 5."
