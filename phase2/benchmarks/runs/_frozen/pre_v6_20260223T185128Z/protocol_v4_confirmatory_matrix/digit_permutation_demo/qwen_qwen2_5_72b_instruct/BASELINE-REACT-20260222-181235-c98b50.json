The key steps are to generate all possible numbers from the digits, check if they are divisible by 4, and then select the largest valid number.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Since there are no tools available, I will manually generate permutations of the digits and check each for divisibility by 4, starting from the largest possible number to find the first (and thus the largest) valid number.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Let's start with the largest possible permutation of the digits [6, 2, 1, 0] and work our way down to find the largest number that meets the criteria.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK:",

After generating these permutations, I will check each number to see if it is divisible by 4 and does not exceed 6120. I will keep track of the largest valid number found.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Starting with the largest possible permutation, which is 6210, I will check if it is divisible by 4. If not, I will move to the next largest permutation.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: 6210 % 4 = 2, so 6210 is not divisible by 4.

The next permutation after 6210 is 6201.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: 6201 % 4 = 1, so 6201 is not divisible by 4.
