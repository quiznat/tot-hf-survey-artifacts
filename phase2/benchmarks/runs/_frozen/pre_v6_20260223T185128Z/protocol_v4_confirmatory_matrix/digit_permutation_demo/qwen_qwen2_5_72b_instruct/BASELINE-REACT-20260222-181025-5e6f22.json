    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is not clearly defined in the input provided. However, based on the components given ('digits', 'divisor', and 'oracle_max'), it seems like I need to form a number using the digits provided, which when divided by the given divisor results in a quotient that is as close as possible to but does not exceed the 'oracle_max' value. To approach this, I will first try to form the largest possible number from the digits and then check if it meets the criteria. If not, I will adjust accordingly.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Let's start by forming the largest possible number from the digits [6, 6, 8, 4], which is 8664. Now, I will divide this number by the divisor 4 and see if the result is within the 'oracle_max' limit of 8664.\n\nFINAL: Since the largest number formed from the digits is",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task involves forming a number from the given digits such that when divided by the divisor, the result is maximized but does not exceed the 'oracle_max'. Since there are no tools available, all operations will be done through reasoning and calculation.\n\nTHINK: First, let's form the largest possible number from the digits [6, 6, 8, 4]. Sorting these digits in descending order gives us 8664. We will use this number and divide it by the divisor 4 to see if the result is within the 'oracle_max' limit of 8664.\n\nTHINK: 8664 / 4 = 2166, which is less than the 'oracle_max' of 8664. This means the largest number we can form from the digits, when divided by the divisor, gives a valid result.\n\nFINAL: 8664"
