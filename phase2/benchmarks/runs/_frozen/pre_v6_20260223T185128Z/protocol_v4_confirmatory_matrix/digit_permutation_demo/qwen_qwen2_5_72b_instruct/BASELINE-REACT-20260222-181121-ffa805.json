    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to determine if the number formed by the given digits is divisible by the given divisor (8), and it should not exceed the oracle_max value. First, I need to form the number from the digits provided.\n\nACTION: None required, forming the number directly.\nTHINK: The digits [2, 4, 3, 4] can be combined to form the number 2434. Now, I need to check if 2434 is less than or equal to the oracle_max value, which is 4432, and then check if it's divisible by 8.\n\nTHINK: 2434 is less than 4432, so it meets the first condition. To check divisibility by 8, I can perform the division 2434 / 8 and see if there is a remainder.\n\nTHINK: Performing the division 24",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unknown tool 'None'",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: It seems there was a misunderstanding in my previous step. Since there are no available tools, all actions need to be conceptual or mental. I will proceed with the calculation directly.\n\nTHINK: The number formed from the digits [2, 4, 3, 4] is 2434. Now, I need to check if 2434 is less than or equal to 4432 and if it is divisible by 8.\n\nTHINK: 2434 is indeed less than 4432. Next, I will perform the division 2434 / 8 to check for divisibility.\n\nTHINK: 2434 divided by 8 is 304.25, which means there is a remainder. Therefore, 2434 is not divisible by 8.\n\nFINAL: False"
