    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to form numbers from the given digits [0, 4, 8, 1] and check if they are divisible by the given divisor (7). The goal is to find the largest number that meets these criteria, but it should not exceed the oracle_max value (4081).\n\nFirst, I will generate all possible numbers from the digits, then filter out those that are divisible by 7 and do not exceed 4081. Finally, I will select the largest number from the filtered list.\n\nACTION: None (Since no tools are available, I will perform the necessary calculations and checks manually.)\n\nTHINK: Let's start by generating all possible numbers from the digits [0, 4, 8, 1]. Since the digits can be repeated, we need to consider all permutations of these digits up to the length of the oracle_max value (4081),",
