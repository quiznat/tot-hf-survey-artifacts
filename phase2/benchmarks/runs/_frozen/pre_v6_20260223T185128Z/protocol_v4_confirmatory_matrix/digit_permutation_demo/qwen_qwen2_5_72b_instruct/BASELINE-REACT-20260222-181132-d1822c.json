Generate all possible numbers from the digits.\n2. Filter out numbers that are divisible by the divisor.\n3. From those, select the largest number that is less than or equal to the oracle maximum.\n\nSince there are no available tools, I will proceed with the steps in my reasoning directly.\n\nACTION: THINK Generate all permutations of the digits and convert them to integers.\nTHINK: Let's generate all permutations of the digits [4, 6, 5, 5] and convert them to integers. This will give us all possible numbers that can be formed with these digits.\n\nACTION: THINK Filter out numbers that are divisible",
