    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to form a number from the given digits that is divisible by the provided divisor (8) and does not exceed the oracle_max value (3336). Since there are no external tools available, I will have to use logical reasoning and permutations of the digits to find a valid solution.\n\nACTION: THINK Permutations of the digits [6, 3, 3, 3] will be considered, and for each permutation, I will check if it is divisible by 8 and does not exceed 3336. The divisibility rule for 8 is that the last three digits of the number must form a number that is divisible by 8. Let's start by generating permutations and checking them against these criteria.\nTHINK: First, let's list all unique permutations of the digits [6, 3, 3, 3] and then check each permutation for divisibility by",

I should directly provide the next action or the final answer without labeling further thoughts as \"THINK\" after the initial reasoning. Let me proceed correctly.\n\nThe permutation 3336 is divisible by 8 (3336 / 8 = 417) and does not exceed the maximum allowed value of 3336. Therefore, 3336 is a valid solution.\n\nFINAL: 3336"
