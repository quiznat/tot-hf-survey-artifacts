    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to understand what is expected. The task involves digits [3, 9, 6, 0] and a divisor 11. The goal is likely to form the largest possible number from these digits that is divisible by 11 and does not exceed the oracle maximum of 9603. \n\nI will start by generating all permutations of the given digits and then filter out those which are divisible by 11 and do not exceed 9603. Finally, I will select the largest valid number from the filtered results.\n\nACTION: None required, proceeding with reasoning.\n\nTHINK: Let's list all permutations of the digits [3, 9, 6, 0]:\n- 3960\n- 3906\n- 3690\n- 3609\n- 3096\n- 30",
