    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is not clearly defined. To proceed, I need to make an assumption based on the given inputs: `digits`, `divisor`, and `oracle_max`. A common task with digits and a divisor is to find the largest number that can be formed using the given digits which is divisible by the divisor and does not exceed the `oracle_max`.\n\nGiven:\n- Digits: [0, 4, 5, 1]\n- Divisor: 5\n- Oracle max: 5410\n\nTo form the largest number using the digits [0, 4, 5, 1] that is divisible by 5 and does not exceed 5410, I will first generate all possible numbers from these digits and then filter them based on the criteria.\n\nACTION: GENERATE_PERMUTATIONS [0, 4, 5, 1]\n(Note: Since no tools are available,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since there are no tools available to generate permutations, I will manually generate all possible 4-digit numbers using the digits [0, 4, 5, 1], ensuring that each digit is used exactly once. After generating these numbers, I will filter out those that do not meet the criteria of being divisible by 5 and not exceeding 5410. \n\nThe digit 0 cannot be the leading digit of any number because it would result in a 3-digit number or less, which is not what we want. Therefore, I will only consider permutations where 0 is not the leading digit.\n\nACTION: MANUAL_GENERATE_PERMUTATIONS [0, 4, 5, 1]\n(Note: This is a conceptual action since no actual tool is available.)\nTHINK: Manually generating permutations of the digits [0, 4, 5, 1] where 0 is not the leading digit",
