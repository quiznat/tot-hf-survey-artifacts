Since no tools are available, I need to manually check each permutation of the digits to see if they meet the criteria.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: To start, I will generate all unique permutations of the digits [1, 9, 9, 8] and then filter out those that are greater than 9981. Afterward, I'll check which of these numbers are divisible by 3.\n\nACTION: None\n\nTHINK: Let's list out the permutations:\n- 1998\n- 1989\n- 1899\n- 9198\n- 9189\n- 9819\n-",
