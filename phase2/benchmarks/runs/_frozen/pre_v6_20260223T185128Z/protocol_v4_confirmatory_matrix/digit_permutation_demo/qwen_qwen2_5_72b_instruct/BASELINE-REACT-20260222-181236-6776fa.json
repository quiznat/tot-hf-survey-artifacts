    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the given digits (1, 3, 3, 2) which is divisible by the given divisor (6), and is less than or equal to the oracle maximum (3312). To solve this, I need to generate all possible permutations of the digits and check each for divisibility by 6, while also ensuring it does not exceed 3312.\n\nACTION: PERMUTE [1, 3, 3, 2]",

Given the small number of digits, I can enumerate the permutations in my reasoning process.\n\nTHINK: The permutations of [1, 3, 3, 2] are: 1332, 1323, 1233, 3132, 3123, 3312, 3321, 3231, 3213, 2133, 2313, 2331.

    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: Continuing from the previous step, I need to check each of the listed permutations for two conditions: divisibility by 6 and not exceeding 3312. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. For divisibility by 2, the number must end in an even digit. For divisibility by 3, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. The digits add up to 9, which is divisible by 3, so all permutations will meet the divisibility by 3 condition. We just need to check for the last digit being even and the value not exceeding 3312.\n\nChecking each permutation:\n- 1332: Ends with 2 (even), total = 1332 (\u2264 3312)\n- 1323: Ends with 3 (odd)\n- 123",
