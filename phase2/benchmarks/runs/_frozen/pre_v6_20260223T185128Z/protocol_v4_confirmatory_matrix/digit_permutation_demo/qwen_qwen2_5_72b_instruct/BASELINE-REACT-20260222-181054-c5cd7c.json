    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve manipulating the given digits to form a number that is divisible by the provided divisor (5 in this case). The goal is to maximize this number under the constraint that it does not exceed the `oracle_max` value (8110 in this case). Since no tools are available, I will solve this problem through logical reasoning and basic arithmetic.\n\nGiven the digits [1, 1, 0, 8] and the divisor 5, a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. Since we do not have the digit 5 in our list, the only option is to use 0 as the last digit. This means we need to form the largest possible number with the remaining digits [1, 1, 8] and append 0 at the end.\n\nLet's try forming the largest number with the digits [1, 1, 8",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing from the previous thought, the largest number we can form with the digits [1, 1, 8] is 811. By appending 0 to the end, the number becomes 8110. We need to check if this number is within the `oracle_max` limit (8110) and is divisible by the divisor (5).\n\nSince 8110 is exactly equal to the `oracle_max` and ends with 0, it is both within the limit and divisible by 5. Therefore, 8110 is a valid solution.\n\nFINAL: 8110"
