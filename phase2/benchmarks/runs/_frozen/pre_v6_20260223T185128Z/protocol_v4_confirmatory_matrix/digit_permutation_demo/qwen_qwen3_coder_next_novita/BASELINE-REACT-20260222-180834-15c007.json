The oracle_max is given as 9603, which suggests that 9603 is the correct answer \u2014 but I should verify it.\n\nFirst, check if 9603 is divisible by 11:\n- Rule for divisibility by 11: alternating sum of digits must be divisible by 11.\n- Digits of 9603: 9, 6, 0, 3 \u2192 (9 + 0) \u2212 (6 + 3) = 9 \u2212 9 = 0, and 0 is divisible by 11 \u2192 yes.\n\nNow verify that 9603 uses exactly the digits [3, 9, 6, 0] \u2014 yes:",
