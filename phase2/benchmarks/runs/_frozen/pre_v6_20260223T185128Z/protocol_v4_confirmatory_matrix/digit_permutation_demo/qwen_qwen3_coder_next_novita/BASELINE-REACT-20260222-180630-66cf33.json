    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [0, 4, 3, 1] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 4, and it must be \u2264 oracle_max = 3140.\n\nRecall: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nWe need to consider all permutations of the digits [0, 4, 3, 1] to form 4-digit numbers (since leading zero would make it a 3-digit number, but we can consider numbers with fewer digits only if they are \u2264 3140 and still use all digits? Wait \u2014 the task says \"using the digits\", typically meaning each digit exactly once, so 4-digit numbers only, but leading zero is not allowed (i.e., first digit \u2260 0). So valid numbers are 4-digit numbers",
