    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [4, 1, 8, 8]. The oracle_max is 8184, which suggests that 8184 is the correct answer (since it's divisible by 4 and uses digits 8,1,8,4). Let's verify:  \n- Digits available: 4,1,8,8  \n- Possible permutations: We want the largest possible number divisible by 4.  \n- Divisibility rule for 4: last two digits must form a number divisible by 4.  \n- Try largest possible numbers:  \n  - 8841 \u2192 last two digits 41 \u2192 41 mod 4 = 1 \u2192 no  \n  - 8814 \u2192 14 mod 4 = 2 \u2192",

The oracle_max is 8184, so we suspect that's the answer, but let's verify systematically.\n\nFirst, list all unique permutations of [4,1,8,8] in descending order:\n\n- 8841 \u2192 last two digits 41 \u2192 41 mod 4 = 1 \u2192 not divisible  \n- 8814 \u2192 14 mod 4 = 2 \u2192 no  \n- 8481 \u2192 81 mod 4 = 1 \u2192 no  \n- 8418 \u2192 18 mod 4 = 2 \u2192 no  \n- 8184 \u2192 84 mod 4 = 0 \u2192 yes!
