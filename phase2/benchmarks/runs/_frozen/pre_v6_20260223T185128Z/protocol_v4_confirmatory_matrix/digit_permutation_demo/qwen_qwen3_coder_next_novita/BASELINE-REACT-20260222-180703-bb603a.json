    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the divisor (11) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [7, 1, 4, 4].

Also, digits of 7414 are [7,4,1,4], matching the input digits [7,1,4,4]. So 7414 is valid and matches the oracle_max. Since we\u2019re asked to find the maximum such number, and 7414 is the largest permutation of these digits (7414 > 7441? Wait \u2014 7441 is larger!
