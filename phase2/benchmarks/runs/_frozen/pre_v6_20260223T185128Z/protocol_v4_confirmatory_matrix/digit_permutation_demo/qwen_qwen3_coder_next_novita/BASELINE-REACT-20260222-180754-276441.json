    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [4, 4, 5, 9]. The oracle_max is given as 9544, which suggests that 9544 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if 9544 is indeed divisible by 4 and can be formed from the digits [4, 4, 5, 9].\n\nFirst, check if 9544 uses only the digits 4, 4, 5, 9:\n- Digits in 9544: 9, 5, 4, 4 \u2192 matches exactly.\n\nNext, check divisibility by 4:\n- A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n- Last two digits of 9544",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9544, the last two digits are 44. Since 44 \u00f7 4 = 11 (an integer), 44 is divisible by 4, so 9544 is divisible by 4. Also, 9544 uses digits 9, 5, 4, 4 \u2014 exactly matching the input digits [4, 4, 5, 9]. Therefore, 9544 is a valid candidate and matches the oracle_max. Since we are to find the maximum such number, and 9544 is the largest possible permutation (starting with 9, then 5, then 4, then 4), and it satisfies the divisibility condition, it must be the answer.",
