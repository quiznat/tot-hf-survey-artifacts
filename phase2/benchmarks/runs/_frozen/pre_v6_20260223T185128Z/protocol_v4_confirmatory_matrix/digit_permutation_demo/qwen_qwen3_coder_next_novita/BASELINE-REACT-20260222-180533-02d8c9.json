    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by rearranging the digits [9, 1, 3, 8] such that the number is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum is 9318. Let's verify if 9318 is divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even. 9318 ends in 8 \u2192 even \u2192 OK.\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9 + 3 + 1 + 8 = 21 \u2192 21 \u00f7 3 = 7 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 OK.\n\nSo 9318 is divisible by 6.\n\nNow, is it the maximum",
