    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [3, 2, 9, 8] such that the number is divisible by 11, and it should not exceed the oracle_max value of 9823. Let's recall the divisibility rule for 11: the alternating sum of the digits (sum of digits in odd positions minus sum of digits in even positions) must be a multiple of 11 (including 0).\n\nFirst, list all permutations of [3, 2, 9, 8] in descending order (since we want the largest valid number \u2264 9823), and check divisibility by 11.\n\nAll permutations of the digits in descending order (starting from largest possible 4-digit number):\n\n- 9832 \u2192 check if \u2264 9823?
