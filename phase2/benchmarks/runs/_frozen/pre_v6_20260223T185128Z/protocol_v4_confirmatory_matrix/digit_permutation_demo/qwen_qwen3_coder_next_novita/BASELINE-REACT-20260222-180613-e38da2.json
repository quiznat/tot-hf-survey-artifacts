    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark problem using a ReAct loop, but no tools are available. The input provides digits [0, 0, 5, 1], a divisor 7, and an oracle_max of 1050. Since no tools are available, I cannot perform actions like searching or querying. The problem likely involves reconstructing or reasoning about a number formed by the digits, possibly checking divisibility or maximizing something under constraints.\n\nDigits [0, 0, 5, 1] can form numbers like 5100, 5010, 5001, 1500, 1050, 1005, etc. Note that 1050 is exactly the oracle_max. Let\u2019s check if 1050 is divisible by 7: 1050 \u00f7 7 = 15",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The digits [0, 0, 5, 1] can be arranged to form various 4-digit numbers (allowing leading zeros would make them effectively 3- or 4-digit numbers, but since two digits are zero, the largest valid numbers won\u2019t have leading zeros). The maximum possible number from these digits is 5100, but the oracle_max is 1050 \u2014 suggesting the task may be to find the *largest number \u2264 oracle_max* that can be formed using exactly these digits and is divisible by the divisor (7). We already saw 1050 = 7 \u00d7 150, so it's divisible by 7. Does 1050 use exactly the digits [0, 0, 5, 1]? Yes: digits of 1050 are [1, 0, 5, 0] \u2014 matches the",
