    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by a given divisor, using a set of digits. The input provides digits [4, 2, 2, 4], divisor 11, and an oracle_max of 4422. Since no tools are available, I must deduce the answer logically.\n\nFirst, note that the digits [4, 2, 2, 4] can form permutations like 4224, 4242, 4422, 2442, 2424, 2244, etc.\n\nThe oracle_max is given as 4422, which suggests that 4422 is the largest valid number meeting the criteria (i.e., divisible by 11 and formed from those digits). Let\u2019s verify if 4422 is divisible by 11.\n\nDivisibility rule",
