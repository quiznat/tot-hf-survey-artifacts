    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [0, 4, 5, 1] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and it's given that the oracle_max is 5410. Since the number must be divisible by 5, its last digit must be either 0 or 5. To maximize the number, we want the largest possible digits in the higher places.\n\nLet\u2019s list all permutations of [0, 4, 5, 1] ending in 0 or 5 and find the maximum divisible by 5.\n\nPermutations ending in 0:\n- 5410 \u2192 5410\n- 5140 \u2192 5140\n- 4510 \u2192 4510\n- 4150 \u2192 4150\n- 1",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number formed using digits [0, 4, 5, 1] exactly once, divisible by 5, and the oracle_max is given as 5410. Since divisibility by 5 requires last digit 0 or 5, and to maximize the number, we prefer larger digits in higher places. The largest possible permutation ending in 0 is 5410 (digits in descending order: 5,4,1,0). Check if 5410 is divisible by 5: 5410 \u00f7 5 = 1082, which is integer \u2014 yes.
