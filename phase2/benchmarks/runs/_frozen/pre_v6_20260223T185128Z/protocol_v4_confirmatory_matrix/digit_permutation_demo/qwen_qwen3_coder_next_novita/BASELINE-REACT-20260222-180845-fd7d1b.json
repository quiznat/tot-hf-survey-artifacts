We verified that 7530 uses all digits, ends in 0 (so divisible by 2), and digit sum is 15 (divisible by 3), hence divisible by 6. Now, is there any larger permutation? The largest possible 4-digit number from these digits is 7530 (since digits sorted descending: 7,5,3,0 \u2192 7530). Any other permutation would be smaller (e.g., 7503 < 7530, 7350 < 7530, etc.). So 7530 is indeed the maximum valid number",
