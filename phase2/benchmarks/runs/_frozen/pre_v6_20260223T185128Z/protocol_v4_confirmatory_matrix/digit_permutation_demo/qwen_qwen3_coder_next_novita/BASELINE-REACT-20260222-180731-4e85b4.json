    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (7) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [6, 4, 7, 7]. The oracle_max is given as 7476, which suggests that 7476 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if it's indeed the maximum possible number divisible by 7 using those digits.\n\nFirst, list all permutations of [6, 4, 7, 7] (accounting for duplicate 7s), sort them in descending order, and check divisibility by 7.\n\nAll unique permutations of [6,4,7,7] (4 digits with two 7s):  \nTotal permutations = 4! / 2! = 12.\n\nList them in descending order (largest first):\n\nStart with highest possible thousands digit: 7  \nThen remaining digits [6,",

Let's compute: 7 \u00d7 1068 = 7476 (since 7\u00d71000=7000, 7\u00d768=476, so 7000+476=7476). Yes!
