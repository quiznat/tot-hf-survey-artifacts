    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 6 that can be formed by permuting the digits [1, 3, 3, 2]. The oracle_max is given as 3312, which suggests that 3312 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if 3312 is indeed divisible by 6 and can be formed from the digits [1, 3, 3, 2].\n\nFirst, check divisibility by 6: a number divisible by 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisible by 2: last digit must be even. 3312 ends in 2 \u2192 OK.\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Digits of 3312: 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 9 \u2192 9",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 9, which is divisible by 3, so 3312 is divisible by 3. It ends in 2, so it's even \u2192 divisible by 2. Therefore, 3312 is divisible by 6. Now, check if 3312 can be formed from the digits [1, 3, 3, 2]. The digits of 3312 are [3, 3, 1, 2], which exactly match the given digits [1, 3, 3, 2] (order doesn\u2019t matter). So 3312 is a valid permutation and divisible by 6. Since the oracle_max is 3312, and we've verified it's valid, it must be the maximum such number. To be thorough, we could consider if any larger permutation exists \u2014 the largest possible permutation of",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The largest possible permutation of digits [1, 3, 3, 2] is 3321. But 3321 ends in 1 (odd), so not divisible by 2 \u2192 not divisible by 6. Next, try 3312 \u2014 which we already verified is divisible by 6 and uses the correct digits. Any permutation larger than 3312 would have to be \u22653321, but 3321 is invalid (odd), and the next candidates like 3312 is the highest valid one. So 3312 is indeed the maximum divisible by 6. Final answer confirmed.",
