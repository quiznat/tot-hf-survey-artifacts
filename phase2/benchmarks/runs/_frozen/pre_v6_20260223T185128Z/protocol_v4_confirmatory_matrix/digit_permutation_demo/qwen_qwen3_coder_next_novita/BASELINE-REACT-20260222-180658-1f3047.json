    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [8, 3, 8, 4]. The oracle_max is 8384, which is likely the maximum possible number formed by those digits (8,3,8,4 \u2192 8384), but it may not be divisible by 4. We need to find the largest permutation of these digits that is divisible by 4.\n\nRecall: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nDigits: [8, 3, 8, 4] \u2192 possible permutations (sorted descending to find max first):\n- 8843\n- 8834\n- 8483\n- 8438\n- 8384 (oracle_max)\n-",

Let\u2019s list all unique permutations in descending order and check the last two digits.\n\nFirst, sort digits descending: [8, 8, 4, 3] \u2192 max number = 8843  \nBut we need to generate permutations in descending order and test divisibility by 4.\n\nLet\u2019s generate candidates in descending numeric order:\n\n1. 8843 \u2192 last two digits = 43 \u2192 43 mod 4 = 3 \u2192 not divisible  \n2. 8834 \u2192 last two = 34 \u2192 34 mod 4 = 2 \u2192 no  \n3. 8483 \u2192 83 mod 4 = 3 \u2192 no",

Let's list all permutations of [8,3,8,4] in descending order properly.\n\nAll unique permutations (sorted descending):\n- 8843  \n- 8834  \n- 8483  \n- 8438  \n- 8384 \u2190 first divisible by 4  \n-",

Since it matches the oracle_max and satisfies the divisibility condition, it is the maximum valid number. No further checks are needed.\nFINAL: 8384"
