    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (5) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [1, 6, 5, 2]. The oracle_max is 6215, which is likely the maximum possible number formed by those digits (since digits sorted descending: 6, 5, 2, 1 \u2192 6521, but 6215 is given as oracle_max, so maybe it's the max *divisible* by 5? Wait \u2014 numbers divisible by 5 must end in 0 or 5. Among digits [1,6,5,2], only 5 can be at the end. So the max number ending in 5 is formed by putting 5 at the end and sorting the rest descending: 6,2,1,5 \u2192 6215. Indeed, 621",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 5 that can be formed by rearranging the digits [1, 6, 5, 2]. A number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5. Since 0 is not among the digits, the last digit must be 5. To maximize the number, we place the remaining digits [1, 6, 2] in descending order before 5: 6, 2, 1 \u2192 6215. Check: 6215 \u00f7 5 = 1243, which is an integer. The oracle_max is given as 6215, confirming this is the correct answer.",
