    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [4, 5, 5, 0]. The oracle_max is given as 5540, which suggests that 5540 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if it's achievable and divisible by 4.\n\nFirst, check if 5540 can be formed from digits [4, 5, 5, 0]: digits of 5540 are [5, 5, 4, 0] \u2014 yes, matches exactly.\n\nNow check divisibility by 4: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. Last two digits of 5540 are \"40\", and 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 \u2192 divisible.\n\nSo",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 5540, which uses digits [5,5,4,0] \u2014 exactly matching the input digits [4,5,5,0]. The number 5540 ends in \"40\", and since 40 is divisible by 4, the entire number is divisible by 4. No larger permutation of these digits is possible: the permutations in descending order are 5540, 5504, 5450, 5405, etc. Checking 5504: last two digits \"04\" = 4, divisible by 4 \u2192 5504 is also divisible by 4, but 5540 > 5504. So 5540 is indeed the maximum. No further action needed.\nFINAL: 5540"
