    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [6, 6, 8, 4]. The oracle_max is given as 8664, which suggests that 8664 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if it's indeed the maximum possible number divisible by 4 using those digits.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nDigits available: [6, 6, 8, 4]\n\nWe want the largest possible number, so we should try to arrange digits in descending order: 8664.\n\nCheck if 8664 is divisible by 4: last two digits = 64. 64 \u00f7 4 = 16 \u2192 yes,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The digits [6, 6, 8, 4] can form numbers in descending order as 8664. Since 64 (last two digits) is divisible by 4, 8664 is divisible by 4. Now, is there any larger permutation? The next possible larger arrangement would require a higher digit in the thousands place, but 8 is already the largest digit, so thousands digit = 8 is optimal. With 8 fixed, the next digit should be as large as possible: remaining digits [6, 6, 4] \u2192 next largest is 6. So 86xx. Then for hundreds place, remaining [6, 4] \u2192 choose 6 \u2192 866x, then 4 \u2192 8664. Any other arrangement like 8646: last two digits 46 \u2192 46 \u00f7",
