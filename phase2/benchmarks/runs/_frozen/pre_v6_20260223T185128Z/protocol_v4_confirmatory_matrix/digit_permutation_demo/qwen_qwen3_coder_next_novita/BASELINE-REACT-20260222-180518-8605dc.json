    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (3) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [1, 3, 2, 9]. The oracle_max is 9321, which is the maximum possible number from those digits (9,3,2,1). We need to check if 9321 is divisible by 3. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation divisible by 3.\n\nDivisibility rule for 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nDigits: 1 + 3 + 2 + 9 = 15 \u2192 15 is divisible by 3, so any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the largest permutation (9321) is divisible by 3.\n\nCheck: 9321 \u00f7 3 = 310",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the digits is 1 + 3 + 2 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, every permutation of these digits is divisible by 3. The largest possible permutation is 9321, which matches the oracle_max. Since 9321 \u00f7 3 = 3107 (not 310 \u2014 correction), it is indeed divisible. So the answer is 9321.\nFINAL: 9321"
