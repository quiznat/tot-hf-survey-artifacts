The number should also not exceed 6342.\n\nLet me consider what numbers can be formed with these digits and check their divisibility by 7.\n\nFirst, let me think about the constraints:\n1. Use each digit exactly once: 3, 6, 2, 4\n2. Form a 4-digit number (since we have 4 digits)\n3. The number must be divisible by 7\n4. The number must be \u2264 6342\n\nSince we're looking for divisibility by 7, I'll need to check various arrangements of these digits to see which ones are divisible by 7.\n\nLet me try",

Since we want the largest possible number \u2264 6342, I should start with arrangements beginning with 6 (the largest digit) and work down.\n\nThe constraint is that the number must be divisible by 7. I'll need to check several combinations.\n\nLet me first list some arrangements starting with 6:\n- 6432: 6432 \u00f7 7 = 918.857... (not divisible)\n- 6423: 6423 \u00f7 7 = 917.571...
