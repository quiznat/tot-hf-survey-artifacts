    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a number formed by arranging the digits [3, 9, 6, 0] that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max of 9603 suggests this might be the maximum possible value, but I should check all arrangements systematically.\n\nLet me think about divisibility by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits (starting with +) is divisible by 11.\n\nFor a 4-digit number with digits a, b, c, d, the alternating sum is a - b + c - d.\n\nI have digits [3, 9, 6, 0]. Let me try different arrangements and check their alternating sums.\n\nLet me also consider that 0 cannot be the first digit in a 4-digit number.\n\nLet me systematically check some arrangements:\n- 3960: alternating sum = 3 -",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me systematically check all valid 4-digit arrangements of digits [3, 9, 6, 0] to find which ones are divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, let me recall the rule for divisibility by 11: For a number with digits a, b, c, d, calculate a - b + c - d. If this result is divisible by 11, then the number is divisible by 11.\n\nSince 0 cannot be the first digit, valid arrangements start with 3, 9, or 6.\n\nLet me check some arrangements:\n\nFor arrangement 3960: alternating sum = 3 - 9 + 6 - 0 = 0. Since 0 is divisible by 11, 3960 works!\n\nLet me verify: 3960 \u00f7 11 = 360. Yes, this is correct",
