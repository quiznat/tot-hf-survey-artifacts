Since I don't have a 0 digit, the number must end in 5.\n\nTo maximize the number while keeping it under 9825, I should try to form the largest possible number ending in 5 that doesn't exceed 9825.\n\nLet me consider what numbers I can make with these digits that end in 5:\n- 9825 would be ideal but I need to check if I can make it\n- 9852 - no, this uses 2, 5, 8, 9 but I need to check if it's valid\n- 9",

Is as large as possible\n\nFirst, let me check if I can make 9825 exactly:\n- 9825 uses digits 9, 8, 2, 5 - all available digits \u2713\n- It ends in 5, so divisible by 5 \u2713\n- It equals 9825, which doesn't exceed 9825 \u2713\n\nSo 9825 itself satisfies all conditions. But let me double-check if there's a larger valid number.\n\nSince 9825 is exactly at the limit, and we want the maximum number \u2264 9825,",
