    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a number using the digits [4, 4, 5, 9] that is divisible by 4 and does not exceed 9544. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what makes a number divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check what two-digit combinations from the available digits [4, 4, 5, 9] are divisible by 4:\n- 44: 44 \u00f7 4 = 11 \u2713\n- 45: 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2717\n- 49: 49 \u00f7 4 = 12.25 \u2717\n- 54: 54 \u00f7 4 = 1",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me reconsider this more carefully. I need to find a 4-digit number using the digits [4, 4, 5, 9] that is divisible by 4 and \u2264 9544.\n\nFor divisibility by 4, the last two digits must form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check all possible two-digit endings from digits [4, 4, 5, 9]:\n- 44: 44 \u00f7 4 = 11 \u2713 (divisible)\n- 45: 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2717\n- 49: 49 \u00f7 4 = 12.25 \u2717\n- 54: 54 \u00f7 4 = 13.5 \u2717\n- 59: 59 \u00f7 4 = 14",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: I need to continue my analysis. Let me check the remaining two-digit combinations and then build the largest valid 4-digit number.\n\nFrom the digits [4, 4, 5, 9], the possible two-digit endings that are divisible by 4 are:\n- 44 (since 44 \u00f7 4 = 11)\n\nSo the last two digits must be 44. This means I have used two 4's already, leaving me with one 5 and one 9 to form the first two digits.\n\nTo maximize the number and keep it \u2264 9544, I should try to make the first digit as large as possible while ensuring the entire number doesn't exceed 9544.\n\nIf I use 95 as the first two digits, the number would be 9544, which equals the oracle_max of 9544. This satisfies both conditions",
