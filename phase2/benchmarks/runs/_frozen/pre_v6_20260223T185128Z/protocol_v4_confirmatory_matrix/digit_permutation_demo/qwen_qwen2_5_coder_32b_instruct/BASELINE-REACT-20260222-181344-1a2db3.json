The number must not exceed 8470\n\nSince I'm looking for the maximum such number, I should try to form the largest possible numbers first and check if they're divisible by 7.\n\nThe largest possible 4-digit number using these digits would be 8740, but let me check if there's a larger valid number.\n\nActually, let me approach this more carefully by checking all possible arrangements in descending order:",

Since 8470 is the largest possible number using these digits (it uses all digits exactly once), and it's divisible by 7, this should be my answer.\n\nBut let me double-check by verifying 8470 is indeed divisible by 7:\n8470 \u00f7 7 = 1210\n\nYes, this is an integer, so 8470 is divisible by 7.\n\nLet me also verify that 8470 uses the digits [8, 7, 0, 4] exactly once:\n- Contains 8 \u2713\n- Contains 7 \u2713  \n- Contains 0 \u2713\n-",
