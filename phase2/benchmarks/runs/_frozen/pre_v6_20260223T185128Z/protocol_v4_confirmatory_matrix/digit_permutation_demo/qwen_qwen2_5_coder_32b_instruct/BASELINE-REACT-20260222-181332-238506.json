I have four digits: 8, 1, 6, 0. I can arrange them in different orders to create various numbers.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\nThe sum of my digits is: 8 + 1 + 6 + 0 = 15\nSince 15 is divisible by 3, any arrangement of these four digits will form a number divisible by 3.\n\nNow I need to find the largest possible number using these digits that doesn't exceed 8610.\n\nTo maximize the number, I should arrange the digits in descending order",
