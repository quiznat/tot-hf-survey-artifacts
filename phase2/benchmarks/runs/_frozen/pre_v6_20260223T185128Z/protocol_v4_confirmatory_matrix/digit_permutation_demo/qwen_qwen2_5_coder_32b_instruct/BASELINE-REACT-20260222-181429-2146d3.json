A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check what two-digit combinations from the available digits [9, 6, 2, 7] are divisible by 4:\n- 96: 96 \u00f7 4 = 24 \u2713\n- 92: 92 \u00f7 4 = 23 \u2713\n- 97: 97 \u00f7 4 = 24.25 \u2717\n- 69: 69 \u00f7 4 = 17.25",
