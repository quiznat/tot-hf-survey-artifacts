    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task using the given digits [8, 8, 4, 9] and divisor 8. The oracle_max is 9848, which seems to be an upper bound for the solution.\n\nLet me think about what this task might be asking:\n1. I have four digits: 8, 8, 4, 9\n2. I have a divisor: 8\n3. There's an oracle_max: 9848\n\nThis could be asking me to:\n- Create a number using these digits that is divisible by 8\n- Find the largest possible number using these digits that is divisible by 8\n- Something else entirely\n\nSince no tools are available, I'll need to work with basic arithmetic and logic.\n\nLet me first check if any arrangement of these digits forms a number divisible by 8.

I have digits [8, 8, 4, 9] and need to use them to create a number divisible by 8, with the constraint that the result should not exceed 9848.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 8, I need to check the divisibility rule. Actually, let me approach this differently - I should try to form numbers using these digits and check divisibility.\n\nThe key insight is that I can arrange these digits in different orders to form different numbers. Since I want the largest possible number that's divisible by 8 and doesn't exceed 9848, I should start with the largest arrangements.\n\nLet me consider what numbers I can make:\n- 9884\n- 9848 \n- 9488\n- 8984\n- 8948\n- 8",
