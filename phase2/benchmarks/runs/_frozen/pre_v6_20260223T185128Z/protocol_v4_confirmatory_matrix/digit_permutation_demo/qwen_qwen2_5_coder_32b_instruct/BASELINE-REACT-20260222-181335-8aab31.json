    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a number that can be formed using the digits [9, 1, 3, 8] and is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. For divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even. For divisibility by 3, the sum of all digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet me check the sum of available digits: 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 21. Since 21 is divisible by 3, any arrangement of these digits will satisfy the divisibility by 3 condition.\n\nFor divisibility by 2, I need an even digit at the end. The even digits available are 8. So the number must end in 8.\n\nNow I need to form the largest possible number under the oracle_max constraint (9318) that uses",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number using digits [9, 1, 3, 8] that is divisible by 6 and less than or equal to 9318.\n\nFrom my analysis:\n- Sum of digits: 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 21, which is divisible by 3 \u2713\n- For divisibility by 2: last digit must be even, so it must end in 8\n- To maximize the number, I want the largest possible arrangement\n\nThe available digits are 9, 1, 3, 8. If the number ends in 8, I need to arrange 9, 1, 3 in the first three positions to make the largest possible number.\n\nThe largest arrangement of 9, 1, 3 is 931.\n\nSo the number would be 9318.\n\nLet me verify:",

Is divisible by 6: \n   - Divisible by 2? Last digit is 8 (even) \u2713\n   - Divisible by 3? Sum of digits = 9 + 3 + 1 + 8 = 21, and 21 \u00f7 3 = 7 \u2713\n3. Is \u2264 oracle_max (9318)? 9318 \u2264 9318 \u2713\n\nSince 9318 is the largest possible number using these digits with 8 as the last digit, and it meets all criteria, this should be the answer.\n\nFINAL: 93"
