I have four digits: 1, 9, 9, 8. I can arrange them in different orders to create various 4-digit numbers.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\nSum of available digits = 1 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 27\nSince 27 is divisible by 3, any arrangement of these digits will form a number divisible by 3.\n\nNow I want the largest possible number \u2264 9981 using these digits.\nTo maximize the number, I should try to place the largest digits in the",
