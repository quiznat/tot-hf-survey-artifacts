    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task using the given digits [4, 5, 5, 0] with divisor 4, and the oracle_max is 5540. Since no tools are available, I need to think through this logically.\n\nI have four digits: 4, 5, 5, 0. I need to use these digits to form numbers that when divided by 4, give a result that doesn't exceed 5540.\n\nLet me consider what numbers I can make with these digits:\n- Single digits: 4, 5, 5, 0\n- Two digits: 45, 54, 50, 40, 55\n- Three digits: 450, 405, 540, 504, 550, 505, 554",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me reconsider this problem more carefully. I need to find numbers formed from digits [4, 5, 5, 0] that when divided by 4 give results \u2264 5540. This means the numbers themselves must be \u2264 5540 \u00d7 4 = 22160.\n\nLooking at possible combinations systematically:\n- With 4 digits: 4550, 4505, 4055, 5450, 5405, 5045, 5540, 5504, 5054\n- The largest possible number is 5540, which divided by 4 gives 1385, well under 5540.\n\nBut wait - I should check if there's a specific interpretation. Maybe I need to form two numbers and divide them?",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Let me re-read the problem carefully. It says \"digits [4, 5, 5, 0]\" and asks about division by 4 with oracle_max 5540. \n\nThe most logical interpretation is: I need to form numbers using these digits and check if they're divisible by 4, with the constraint that the quotient doesn't exceed 5540.\n\nSince we want the quotient to be \u2264 5540, the dividend must be \u2264 5540 \u00d7 4 = 22160.\n\nLet me list all possible 4-digit numbers using digits [4, 5, 5, 0]:\n- 4550, 4505, 4055, 5450, 5405, 5045, 5540, 5504, 5",
    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I need to reconsider the problem. Looking at the available digits [4, 5, 5, 0], I should form numbers and check divisibility by 4, ensuring the quotient doesn't exceed 5540. \n\nThe maximum allowed dividend is 5540 \u00d7 4 = 22160. All 4-digit arrangements of these digits will be \u2264 5540 (since 5540 is the largest possible arrangement), so all such numbers will satisfy the quotient constraint.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if I'm supposed to form a single number or multiple numbers. Given the phrasing, it seems like I should form one number using all four digits.\n\nThe valid 4-digit numbers using digits [4, 5, 5, 0] are:\n4550, 4505, 4055, 545",
    "STEP 4 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 5 MODEL: THINK: I need to clarify the problem. The task involves digits [4, 5, 5, 0], divisor 4, and oracle_max 5540. I interpret this as forming a number using all four digits and checking if that number divided by 4 gives a result \u2264 5540. \n\nThe maximum value I can form with digits [4, 5, 5, 0] is 5540. When 5540 is divided by 4, the result is 1385, which is indeed \u2264 5540. So any arrangement of these digits will work since they're all \u2264 5540.\n\nLet me list all valid 4-digit numbers that can be made with [4, 5, 5, 0]:\n- 4550\n- 4505  \n- 405",
