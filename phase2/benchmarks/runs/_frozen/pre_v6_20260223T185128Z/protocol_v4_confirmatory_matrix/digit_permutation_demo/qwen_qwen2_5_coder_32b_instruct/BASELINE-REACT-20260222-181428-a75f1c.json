    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task. Looking at the input, I have:\n- digits: [2, 0, 1, 1] \n- divisor: 8\n- oracle_max: 1120\n\nSince no tools are available, I need to think through what this might be asking. This looks like it could be about finding a number formed by these digits that is divisible by 8, or perhaps finding how many numbers can be formed with these digits that are divisible by 8.\n\nLet me consider what numbers can be formed with digits [2, 0, 1, 1] and check which ones are divisible by 8.\n\nFirst, let me list all possible arrangements of these digits:\n- 2011\n- 2010 (but we only have one 0)\n- 2101\n- 2110\n- 10",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me reconsider this more systematically. I have digits [2, 0, 1, 1] and need to find numbers formed by these digits that are divisible by 8.\n\nFirst, let me clarify: I have four digits total - two 1's, one 0, and one 2. I need to form 4-digit numbers using these digits (each digit used exactly once).\n\nThe possible 4-digit numbers are permutations of [2, 0, 1, 1]:\n- 2011\n- 2101  \n- 2110\n- 1021\n- 1102\n- 1120\n- 1201\n- 1210\n- 0112 (not valid as it starts with 0)\n- 0121 (not valid as it starts with",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Let me continue systematically. I have digits [2, 0, 1, 1] and need to form 4-digit numbers where each digit is used exactly once. The constraint is that the resulting number must be divisible by 8.\n\nFirst, let me identify all valid 4-digit permutations (no leading zeros):\n- 2011\n- 2101\n- 2110\n- 1021\n- 1102\n- 1120\n- 1201\n- 1210\n\nNow I'll check which of these are divisible by 8:\n- 2011 \u00f7 8 = 251.375 (not divisible)\n- 2101 \u00f7 8 = 262.625 (not divisible)\n- 2110 \u00f7",
