I need to:\n1. Form numbers using the digits 3, 8, 0, 7 (each digit can be used at most once)\n2. Check which of these numbers are divisible by 7\n3. Among those, find the largest one that doesn't exceed 7308\n\nSince I have 4 digits, I can form 4-digit numbers. The maximum possible 4-digit number using these digits would be 8730 (using all digits in descending order).\n\nLet me check if 8730 is divisible by 7:\n8730 \u00f7 7 = 1247.14...",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me continue systematically. Since 8730 is not divisible by 7, I need to try other combinations. I should work with numbers less than or equal to 7308 since that's the oracle_max limit.\n\nThe largest possible 4-digit number using digits 3,8,0,7 is 8730, but it exceeds our limit of 7308. So I need to consider numbers starting with 7 (since 7308 is the upper bound).\n\nLet me try forming numbers starting with 7:\n- 7830: This uses all digits once, but let me check divisibility\n- 7803: \n- 7380: \n- 7308: This is exactly our limit\n\nLet me check 7308 first since it's our maximum allowed value:\n7308 \u00f7",

Looking at the digits: 7, 3, 0, 8 - yes, we can form 7308 using each digit exactly once.\n\nSince 7308 is divisible by 7 and equals our maximum allowed value, it's the optimal solution.\n\nFINAL: 7308"
