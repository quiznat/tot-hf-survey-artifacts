The available digits are 6, 6, 8, 4.\n\nIf I use 8 as the first digit, I have remaining digits 6, 6, 4.\nI want to make the largest possible number with 8 as the first digit.\nThe largest arrangement would be 8664, but I need to check if this is divisible by 4.\nFor 8664, the last two digits are 64, and 64 \u00f7 4 = 16,",
