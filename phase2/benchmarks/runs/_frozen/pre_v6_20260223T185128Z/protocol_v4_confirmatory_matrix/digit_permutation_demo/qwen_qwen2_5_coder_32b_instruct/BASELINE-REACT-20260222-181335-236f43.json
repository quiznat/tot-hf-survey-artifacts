A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that's divisible by 8.\n\nLet me try different arrangements of the digits [6, 3, 3, 3] to create numbers and check divisibility by 8.\n\nThe available digits are: 6, 3, 3, 3\n\nI should consider all possible 4-digit combinations and check which ones are divisible by 8 and \u2264 3336.\n\nLet me start with the largest possible numbers first since we want to maximize the result while staying under 3336.\n\nThe maximum number we could make is 63",
