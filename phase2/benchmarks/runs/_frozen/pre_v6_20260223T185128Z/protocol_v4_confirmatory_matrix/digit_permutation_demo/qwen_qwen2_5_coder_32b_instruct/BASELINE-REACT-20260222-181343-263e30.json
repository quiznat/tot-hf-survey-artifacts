Since I have four digits, I can form 4-digit numbers. The constraint is that the number must be divisible by 7 and \u2264 8806.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n1. I need to check which arrangements of these digits form numbers divisible by 7\n2. I should start with the largest possible numbers that don't exceed 8806\n3. The maximum possible 4-digit number using these digits would be 8860, but I need to check if it's divisible by 7\n\nActually, let me reconsider - I have digits [0",
