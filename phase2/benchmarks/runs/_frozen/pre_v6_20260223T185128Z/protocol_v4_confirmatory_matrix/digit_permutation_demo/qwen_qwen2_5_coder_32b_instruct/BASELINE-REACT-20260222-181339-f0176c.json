    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task. Looking at the input, I have digits [3, 0, 3, 0] and a divisor of 5. The oracle_max is 3300, which likely represents the maximum value I should consider.\n\nLet me think about what this task might be asking:\n1. I have 4 digits: 3, 0, 3, 0\n2. I need to form numbers that are divisible by 5\n3. I should find the largest such number \u2264 3300\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 5, it must end in 0 or 5.\nLooking at my digits [3, 0, 3, 0], I can only make numbers ending in 0 (since I don't have any 5s).\n\nTo get the largest number \u2264 3300, I want to:\n1",
