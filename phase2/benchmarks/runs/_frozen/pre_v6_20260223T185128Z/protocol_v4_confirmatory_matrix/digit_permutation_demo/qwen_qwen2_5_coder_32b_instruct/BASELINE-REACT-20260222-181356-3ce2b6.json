Since I don't have a 0, the number must end in 5.\n\nTo maximize the number while keeping it under 6215, I should try to form the largest possible number ending in 5 that doesn't exceed 6215.\n\nLet me consider what numbers I can make:\n- The largest digit is 6, so if I start with 6, I need to ensure the resulting number \u2264 6215\n- If I use 6 as the first digit, the remaining digits are [1, 5, 2]\n- To get the largest number \u2264",
