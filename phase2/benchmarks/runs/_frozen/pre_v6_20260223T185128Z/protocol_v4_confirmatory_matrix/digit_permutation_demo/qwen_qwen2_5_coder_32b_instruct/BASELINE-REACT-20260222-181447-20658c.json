    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task. Looking at the input, I have:\n- Digits: [1, 1, 7, 0]\n- Divisor: 7\n- Oracle max: 1701\n\nSince no tools are available, I need to think through this manually. This appears to be about finding numbers that can be formed from the given digits and checking if they're divisible by the divisor.\n\nLet me consider what numbers can be made from digits [1, 1, 7, 0]:\n- Single digit: 1, 7, 0\n- Two digits: 11, 17, 10, 71, 70, 01 (but 01 = 1)\n- Three digits: 117, 110, 171, 170, 101,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me reconsider this problem more systematically. I need to find all possible numbers that can be formed using the digits [1, 1, 7, 0] and then check which ones are divisible by 7.\n\nFirst, let me list all unique numbers that can be formed:\n- Single digit: 0, 1, 7\n- Two digits: 01=1, 10, 11, 17, 70, 71\n- Three digits: 011=11, 017=17, 071=71, 101, 107, 110, 117, 170, 171, 701, 710, 711\n- Four digits: 0117=117,",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: I need to approach this more systematically. The task is asking for numbers that can be formed from the digits [1, 1, 7, 0] that are divisible by 7. Let me first identify all unique numbers that can be formed, then check divisibility by 7.\n\nThe digits are [1, 1, 7, 0]. Since we have two 1's, we need to be careful about counting.\n\nSingle digit numbers: 0, 1, 7\nTwo digit numbers: 01=1, 10, 11, 17, 70, 71 (unique: 0, 1, 10, 11, 17, 70, 71)\nThree digit numbers: We can form 011=11, 017=17, 071",

Looking at the input again:\n- Digits: [1, 1, 7, 0] \n- Divisor: 7\n- Oracle max: 1701\n\nThis seems to be asking for numbers that can be formed using these digits (with repetition allowed based on availability) that are divisible by 7. However, since we only have the specific digits [1, 1, 7, 0], we can only form numbers using these exact digits.\n\nLet me list all possible numbers systematically:\n- Single digit: 0, 1, 7\n- Two digits: 01=1, 10, 11, 17, 70, 71 (unique values: 0, 1, 10, 11, 17, 70,",

Looking at the input:\n- Digits: [1, 1, 7, 0]\n- Divisor: 7  \n- Oracle max: 1701\n\nI believe this is asking for numbers that can be formed using exactly the digits [1, 1, 7, 0] (each digit used as many times as it appears in the list) that are divisible by 7.\n\nLet me systematically list all possible numbers:\n- Single digit: 0, 1, 7\n- Two digits: 01=1, 10, 11, 17, 70, 71 (unique: 0, 1, 10, 11, 17, 70, 71)\n- Three digits: 011=11",
