    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [1, 2, 7, 10]. The available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since no specific operation is given, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with lists include computing sum, product, average, or perhaps checking for patterns. Given the simplicity, sum is a likely candidate. Let me compute the sum using `calc`.\n\nACTION: calc 1 + 2 + 7 + 10",
