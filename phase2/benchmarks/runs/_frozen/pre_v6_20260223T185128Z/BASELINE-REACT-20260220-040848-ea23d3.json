    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [2, 5, 5, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer what the goal might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve computing a result like sum, product, or checking for some property. Given the numbers [2, 5, 5, 7], a plausible goal is to compute their sum: 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 19. Alternatively, maybe it's to compute something like the result of an expression \u2014 but without more context, sum is a reasonable first guess. Let me try using the `calc` tool to compute the sum.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 5 + 5 + 7",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 19",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The calculation returned 19, which matches the sum of the numbers [2, 5, 5, 7]. Since the task is a benchmark with minimal instructions, and the sum is a straightforward and likely intended result, I should verify if this is sufficient or if further steps are needed. However, no additional tasks or checks were specified, and the ReAct loop has produced a clear answer. I can now conclude the task.\nFINAL: 19"
