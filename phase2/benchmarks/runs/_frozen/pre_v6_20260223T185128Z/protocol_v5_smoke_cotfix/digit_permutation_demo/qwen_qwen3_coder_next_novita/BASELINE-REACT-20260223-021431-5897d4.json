    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [1, 9, 0, 8] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 9810, which suggests that 9810 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and divisible by 6). But I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, check if 9810 is divisible by 6 using is_divisible. If yes, that's the answer. If not, try next largest permutations.\n\nBut better: use best_divisible tool, which likely returns the largest permutation divisible by the divisor.\n\nLet\u2019s try ACTION: best_divisible [1,9,0,8] 6\n\nWait \u2014 tool signature? The tools available are best_divisible and is_divisible. Presumably:\n- best_divisible(digits, divisor) returns the largest number",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 9810, which is the largest permutation of [1,9,0,8]. To confirm it's the correct answer, I need to verify it's divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2? Last digit is 0 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3? Sum of digits = 1+9+0+8 = 18 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 9810 is divisible by 6. Since it's the largest permutation and satisfies divisibility, it's the answer. I can verify with is_divisible to be thorough.  \nACTION: is_divisible 9810 6",
