    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 2, 2, 4] that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max is given as 4422, which suggests that 4422 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and divisible by 11). Let's verify:  \n- Permutations of [4,2,2,4] in descending order: 4422, 4242, 4224, 2442, 2424, 2244.  \n- Check divisibility by 11: A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. For 4422: (4 + 2) - (4 + 2) = 6",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The alternating sum for divisibility by 11 is (sum of digits in odd positions) \u2212 (sum of digits in even positions). For 4422: positions (1-indexed from left) are: pos1=4, pos2=4, pos3=2, pos4=2. So odd positions: 4 + 2 = 6; even positions: 4 + 2 = 6; difference = 0, which is divisible by 11. So 4422 is divisible by 11. Since it's the largest permutation (4422 > 4242 > ...), and it's divisible by 11, it must be the answer. Let's confirm with the tool to be safe.  \nACTION: is_divisible 4422  \n11",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: yes"
