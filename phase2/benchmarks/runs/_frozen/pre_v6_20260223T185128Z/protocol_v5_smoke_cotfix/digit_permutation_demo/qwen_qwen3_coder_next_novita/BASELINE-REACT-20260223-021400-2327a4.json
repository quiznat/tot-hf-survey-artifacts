    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [1, 3, 2, 9] that is divisible by 3. The oracle_max is 9321, which is the maximum possible permutation (9,3,2,1). We need to check permutations in descending order until we find one divisible by 3. Since divisibility by 3 depends on the sum of digits, let's first compute the sum: 1 + 3 + 2 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so *all* permutations are divisible by 3. Therefore, the largest permutation (9321) is the answer. But let's verify using the tools as required. We can use `is_divisible` on 9321 to confirm, or directly use `best_divisible` if it's designed to return",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 1 + 3 + 2 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so *every* permutation of these digits is divisible by 3. Therefore, the largest possible permutation \u2014 which is 9321 \u2014 must be divisible by 3. Since the oracle_max is 9321, and it's a valid permutation, it is the answer. We can confirm with `is_divisible(9321, 3)` or directly use `best_divisible([1,3,2,9], 3)`. To follow the ReAct loop, let\u2019s use `best_divisible` as it's designed for this exact purpose.\nACTION: best_divisible [1, 3, 2, 9] 3",
