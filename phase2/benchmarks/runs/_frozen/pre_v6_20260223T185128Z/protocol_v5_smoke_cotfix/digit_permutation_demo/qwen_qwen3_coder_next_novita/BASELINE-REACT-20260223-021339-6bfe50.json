    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 3, 3, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is given as 3336, which suggests that 3336 is the correct answer (since it's the largest such number). But I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nWe have digits: 6, 3, 3, 3.
