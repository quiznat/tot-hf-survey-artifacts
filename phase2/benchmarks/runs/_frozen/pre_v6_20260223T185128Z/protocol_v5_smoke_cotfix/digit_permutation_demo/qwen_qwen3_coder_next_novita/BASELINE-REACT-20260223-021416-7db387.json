    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 1, 6, 0] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 3, and we are told the oracle_max is 8610. Let's verify if 8610 is divisible by 3. Sum of digits: 8 + 6 + 1 + 0 = 15, and 15 is divisible by 3, so 8610 is divisible by 3. Since 8610 is the maximum possible permutation (digits sorted descending: 8,6,1,0 \u2192 8610), and it's divisible by 3, it must be the answer. But to be thorough, let's confirm using the tools. First, check if 8610 is divisible by 3 using is_divisible.\nACTION:",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 8610, which is the largest permutation of the digits [8,1,6,0]. Since the sum of digits is 8+6+1+0 = 15, divisible by 3, 8610 is divisible by 3. Therefore, 8610 is the largest number satisfying the condition. However, to follow the ReAct protocol, I should verify using the available tools. The next step is to call is_divisible with 8610 and divisor 3.\nACTION: is_divisible 8610 3",
