So we have:\n1) 1x - 3y = 0  \n2) 1x + 7y = -30  \n\nWe need to solve this system of two equations in two variables (x, y). The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two equations, that seems like the appropriate tool to use first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[1, -3, 0], [1, 7, -30]]",

To verify correctness, I should use `check_xy` to confirm that this pair satisfies both original equations:  \n1) x - 3y = -9 - 3*(-3) = -9 + 9 = 0 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) x + 7y = -9 + 7*(-3) = -9 - 21 = -30 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nThus, the solution is correct.\n\nACTION: check_xy [-9.0, -3.0]\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: Both equations are satisfied.\nFINAL: x=-9.0, y=-3.0"
