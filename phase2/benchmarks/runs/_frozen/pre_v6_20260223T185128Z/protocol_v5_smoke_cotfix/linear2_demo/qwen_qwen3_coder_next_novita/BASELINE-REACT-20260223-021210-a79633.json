    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form of augmented matrices: [[-2, -3, -10], [1, 4, 20]], which corresponds to:\n- Equation 1: -2x - 3y = -10\n- Equation 2: 1x + 4y = 20\n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution.\n\nSince `solve2` is likely designed for this purpose, I\u2019ll try calling it with the equations.\n\nBut first, I need to determine the expected input format for `solve2`.
