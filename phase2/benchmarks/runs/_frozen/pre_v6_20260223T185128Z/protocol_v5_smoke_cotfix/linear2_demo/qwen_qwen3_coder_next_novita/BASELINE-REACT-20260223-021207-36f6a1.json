    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides the coefficients and constants in the form of equations:  \nEquation 1: -7x - 4y = -31  \nEquation 2: -2x - 2y = -14  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the coefficients and constants \u2014 perhaps as a list of equations in [a, b, c] form meaning ax + by = c. That matches the input structure: [[-7, -4, -31], [-2, -2, -14]]. So `solve2` should be applicable directly.\n\nLet me try ACTION:",

Since the input is already in that form, `solve2([[-7, -4, -31], [-2, -2, -14]])` should yield the solution (x, y). I\u2019ll use `solve2` directly.  \nACTION: solve2 [[-7, -4, -31], [-2, -2, -14]]",
