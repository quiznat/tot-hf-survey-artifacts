    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, the most likely benchmark task is to compute the result of applying arithmetic operations to reach 24 (the classic 24 game). Let's check if [3, 4, 4, 8] can make 24.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, and 4 \u2212 4 = 0, but 24 \u00d7 0 = 0 \u2014 not helpful.\n- (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but no 2.\n- 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4/4) = 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 yes!

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and the goal is likely to form 24 using arithmetic operations (classic 24 game). I found a valid expression: 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4/4) = 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24. However, this uses three 4s, but we only have two 4s. Let's recheck: we have exactly [3, 4, 4, 8] \u2014 two 4s, one 3, one 8. So 4/4 uses both 4s, leaving 8 and 3. Then 8 \u00d7 (4/4) = 8, and 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 but that's (8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4/4) = 24 \u00d7 1",

A valid expression is (8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24. To confirm this computation, I should evaluate it using the `calc` tool.",
