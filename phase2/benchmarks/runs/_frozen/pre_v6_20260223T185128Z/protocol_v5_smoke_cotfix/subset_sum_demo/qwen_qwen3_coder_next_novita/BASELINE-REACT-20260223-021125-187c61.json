I need to use the available tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a list sums to the target. Let me start by trying some combinations. First, I'll try the largest numbers to see if they get close to 50. Let's try [25, 24, 2] = 51 \u2014 too high. [25, 22] = 47 \u2014 close, need 3 more, but no 3.
