    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target value of 57 using the numbers [5, 14, 19, 19, 19]. I have two tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a given list sums to the target. First, I should try summing all the numbers to see what we get.  \nACTION: sum_list [5, 14, 19, 19, 19]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of all numbers is 76, which is greater than the target 57. I need to find a subset of these numbers that sums to 57. Since 76 - 57 = 19, removing one 19 from the full list would give 76 - 19 = 57. The list has three 19s, so removing one yields [5, 14, 19, 19], which should sum to 57. Let me verify this using `sum_list`.\nACTION: sum_list [5, 14, 19, 19]",
