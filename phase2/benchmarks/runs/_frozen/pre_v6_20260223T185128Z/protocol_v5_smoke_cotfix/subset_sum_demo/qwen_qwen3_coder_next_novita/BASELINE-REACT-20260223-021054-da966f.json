    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the given numbers [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 22] that sums to the target 17. I need to use the available tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a list sums to the target. Let me start by trying some combinations. First, I'll try small subsets.\n\nLet me try [3, 5, 6, 3] \u2014 wait, no duplicates allowed unless the number appears multiple times, but the list has unique numbers. So subsets only.\n\nTry [3, 5, 6] = 14 \u2192 too low.  \n[3, 5, 8] = 16 \u2192 still low.  \n[3, 5, 6, 8] =",
