    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the given numbers that sums to the target value 53. The numbers are [2, 7, 11, 16, 21, 22, 23, 25]. I need to use the available tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a list sums to the target. Let me start by trying some combinations. First, I'll try the largest numbers since 53 is relatively large compared to the numbers available. Let's try 25 + 23 = 48, then 48 + 2 = 50, 50 + 7 = 57 (too big). 25 + 21 = 46, 46 + 7 = 53 \u2014 that's exactly the target! So",
