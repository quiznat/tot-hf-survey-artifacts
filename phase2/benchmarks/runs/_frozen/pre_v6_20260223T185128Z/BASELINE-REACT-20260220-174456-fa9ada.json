    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [2, 7, 8, 9], and I have access to a `calc` tool. Since no specific operation is given, I need to infer what the benchmark task might be. Common tasks with a list of numbers include computing sum, product, average, or checking for some property (e.g., is there a pair that sums to something). Given the numbers 2, 7, 8, 9, a plausible task is to compute the sum: 2 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 26. Alternatively, maybe it's to find the maximum, minimum, or sort them. But without more context, the most straightforward is to compute the sum using `calc`. Let me try calculating the sum.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 7 + 8 + 9",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 26",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The calculation returned 26, which is the sum of the numbers [2, 7, 8, 9]. Since the task did not specify an operation, and sum is a common default for such inputs, this seems like a reasonable answer. However, I should consider if other interpretations are possible \u2014 for example, maybe the task is to find the product (2\u00d77\u00d78\u00d79 = 1008), average (26/4 = 6.5), or something else like checking if numbers form a Pythagorean triple (they don\u2019t). But without explicit instructions, sum is the most standard interpretation for a list of numbers in benchmark tasks unless otherwise indicated. The result 26 is consistent and verifiable.\n\nFINAL: 26"
