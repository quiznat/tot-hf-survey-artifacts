    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations in two variables: a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) -8x - 9y = -82  \n2) 7x - 7y = 42  \n\nWe need to solve this system of equations. Let's simplify and solve step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify equation (2): divide both sides by 7 \u2192 x - y = 6 \u2192 x = y + 6.\n\nSubstitute x = y + 6 into equation (1):\n-8(y + 6) - 9y = -82  \n\u2192 -8y - 48 - 9y = -82  \n\u2192 -17y - 48 = -82  \n\u2192 -17y = -34  \n\u2192 y = 2",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From STEP 1, we found y = 2. Now substitute back to find x: x = y + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8. So the solution is x = 8, y = 2. Let's verify in both original equations:\n\nEquation 1: -8(8) - 9(2) = -64 - 18 = -82 \u2714\ufe0f  \nEquation 2: 7(8) - 7(2) = 56 - 14 = 42 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nBoth equations are satisfied. The solution is correct.\nFINAL: x=8, y=2"
