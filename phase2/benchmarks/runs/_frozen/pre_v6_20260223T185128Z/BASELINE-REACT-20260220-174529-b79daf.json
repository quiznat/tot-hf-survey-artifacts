    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 3, 3, 6]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with such inputs involve computing a mathematical expression, e.g., using the numbers in order with operations to reach a target (like 24 game), or computing sum, product, etc. Given the numbers 2, 3, 3, 6, a likely goal is to compute their product or sum, or perhaps evaluate an expression like 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 6. Let\u2019s compute the product: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, 6 \u00d7 3 = 18, 18 \u00d7 6 = 108. Alternatively, sum is 2+3+3+6 = 14. But without a clear target, I should use the available tool `calc",

Since no explicit task is given, the most reasonable interpretation in benchmark contexts is to compute a standard aggregate \u2014 often the sum or product. Given that the numbers are small and the list includes duplicates, computing the product (2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 6) yields 108, while the sum is 14. However, without further context, I should use `calc` to evaluate a likely expression. A common pattern is to compute the product of all numbers. I'll use `calc` to compute 2 * 3 * 3 * 6.",
