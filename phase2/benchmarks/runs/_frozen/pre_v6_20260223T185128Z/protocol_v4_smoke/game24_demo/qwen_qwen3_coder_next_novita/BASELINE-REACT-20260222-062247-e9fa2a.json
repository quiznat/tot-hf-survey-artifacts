    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [4, 10, 7, 3]. No tools are available, and no specific task description is given beyond \"benchmark task\". In such cases, common benchmark tasks involve computing a summary statistic like sum, product, mean, median, max, min, or sorting. Since the numbers are small and simple, perhaps the task is to compute the sum: 4 + 10 + 7 + 3 = 24. Alternatively, maybe it's to sort them: [3, 4, 7, 10]. But without explicit instructions, the most neutral and common interpretation for a list of numbers is to compute the sum. Let\u2019s verify: 4 + 10 = 14, 14 + 7 = 21, 21 + 3 = 24. Yes, sum is 24",
