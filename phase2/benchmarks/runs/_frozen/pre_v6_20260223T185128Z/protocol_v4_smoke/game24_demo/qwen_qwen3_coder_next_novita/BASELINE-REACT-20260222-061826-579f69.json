    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and no tools are available. Since this is a benchmark task and no specific instructions are given, I need to infer what the task might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include: finding the sum, product, mean, median, mode, range, or checking for some property (e.g., can form a rectangle, is a valid hand in poker, etc.). Given the numbers [3, 4, 4, 8], let\u2019s consider possibilities:\n\n- Sum: 3 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 19  \n- Product: 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 8 = 384  \n- Mean: 19 / 4 = 4.75  \n- Median: sorted [3, 4, 4, 8] \u2192 average of middle two = (4",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and no tools are available. Since no specific task instruction is given, I must infer the most likely benchmark task. Common tasks with 4 numbers include checking if they can form a rectangle (opposite sides equal, or two pairs of equal sides). Here, we have two 4s, and 3 and 8 \u2014 not two pairs. Alternatively, maybe it's about forming a valid poker hand: [3, 4, 4, 8] has one pair (4s), so it's a \"one pair\" hand \u2014 but poker hands usually use 5 cards. Another possibility: check if the numbers can form a triangle inequality with three of them, but we have four numbers. Alternatively, maybe it's about arithmetic operations to reach 24 (the 24 game). Let\u2019s test that: can we use 3",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and no tools are available. Since no explicit task is given, I must infer the most likely benchmark task. A very common benchmark with four numbers is the \"24 game\": using each number exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses, reach 24. Let\u2019s test feasibility:\n\nTry combinations:\n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, then need to neutralize the two 4s: e.g., (8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24 \u2705  \nYes! That uses all numbers exactly once: 8 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24.\n\nThus, the task is likely to form 24, and a valid expression exists.",
