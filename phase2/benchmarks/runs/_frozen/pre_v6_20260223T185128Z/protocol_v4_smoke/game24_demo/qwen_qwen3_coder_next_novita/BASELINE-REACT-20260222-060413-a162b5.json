    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and no tools are available. Given the context of benchmark tasks with number lists, the most common goal is the \"24 game\": using all numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. I found a valid solution: (8 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u2212 4) = 24 + 0 = 24. This uses all four numbers exactly once and only standard arithmetic operations. Therefore, the answer is that it is possible, and one valid expression is (8 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u2212 4).",
