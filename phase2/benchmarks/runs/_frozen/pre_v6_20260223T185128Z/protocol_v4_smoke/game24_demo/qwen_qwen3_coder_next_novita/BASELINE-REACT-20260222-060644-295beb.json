    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and no tools are available. Since this is a benchmark task and no specific instruction is given, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include: computing sum, product, mean, checking for duplicates, sorting, finding max/min, or solving a puzzle like 24 game. Given the numbers [3, 4, 4, 8], a classic possibility is the 24 game \u2014 can we use +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24? Let\u2019s test:\n\nTry: 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4/3) = 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1.333\u2026) = 8 \u00d7 (2.666\u2026) = 21.333\u2026 \u2192 no.\n\nTry: (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 +",

Need to use all four numbers exactly once.  \nTry: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24, then 4 and 4 must cancel (e.g., \u00d7 (4/4) = \u00d71). So:",

The expression is valid using only basic arithmetic operations and parentheses. Therefore, the solution is achievable, and the benchmark task likely asks to confirm if 24 can be formed \u2014 answer is yes.",
