    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [2, 10, 10, 3], and no tools are available. This suggests the task may be to compute something from the list, such as sum, product, average, or perhaps to find a pattern or solve a puzzle (e.g., using arithmetic operations to reach a target like 24). Let\u2019s explore common possibilities.\n\nFirst, check if it's a 24 game: using 2, 10, 10, 3 with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses to make 24.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 10 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 25 \u2192 too high\n- 10 \u00d7 2 + 10 \u2212 3 = 20 + 10 \u2212 3 = 27\n- (10 + 2) \u00d7 (10 \u2212",
