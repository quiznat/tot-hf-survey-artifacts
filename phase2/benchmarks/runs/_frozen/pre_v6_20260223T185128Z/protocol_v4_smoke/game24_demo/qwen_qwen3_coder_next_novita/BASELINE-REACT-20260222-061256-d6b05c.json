    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [2, 10, 10, 3], and no tools are available. This suggests the task may be to compute something from the list \u2014 perhaps a mathematical operation like sum, product, average, or maybe to find a pattern or solve a puzzle (e.g., 24 game). Given the numbers [2, 10, 10, 3], a common benchmark is the \"24 game\", where you use all numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s test if 24 is achievable:\n- Try: (10 + 10 + 3) \u2212 2 = 21 \u2192 no  \n- (10 \u00d7 3) \u2212 (10 \u2212 2) = 30 \u2212 8 = 22  \n- (10 + 2)",
