In standard benchmarking for numerical sequences, common tasks include computing the sum, mean, or identifying patterns. Given the repetition of 1 and the progression, another possibility is checking for arithmetic or geometric patterns, but the sequence [1, 4, 1, 6] doesn\u2019t follow a simple arithmetic or geometric rule.\n\nHowever, the most frequently used default metric in such benchmarks\u2014especially when no further context is provided\u2014is the **sum**. Sum = 1 + 4 + 1 + 6 = 12.
