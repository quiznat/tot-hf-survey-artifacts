    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and no tools are available. This suggests the task may be to compute something from the list \u2014 perhaps a sum, product, average, or check for some property (e.g., if it's a valid hand in a card game, or to solve a puzzle like making 24). Since no explicit instruction is given, I need to infer the most likely benchmark task. A common benchmark with 4 numbers is the \"24 game\", where you must use all numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s test if [3, 4, 4, 8] can make 24.\n\nTry:  \n8 \u00d7 3 = 24, and 4 \u2212 4 = 0, so 24 + 0 = 24 \u2192 (8",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and no tools are available. This strongly suggests a classic \"24 game\" benchmark: use all four numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7) and parentheses to make 24. Let\u2019s verify feasibility.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, and 4 \u2212 4 = 0 \u2192 24 + 0 = 24 \u2192 (8 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u2212 4) = 24 \u2714\ufe0f  \nThis uses all numbers exactly once and yields 24.\n\nThus, a valid solution exists. Since the task likely asks whether 24 is achievable (or to produce an expression), and no further instruction is given, the most appropriate final answer is the expression or confirmation.\n\nFINAL: (8 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u2212"
