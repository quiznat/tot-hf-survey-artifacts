    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [4, 10, 7, 3]. No tools are available, and no specific task is described beyond \"benchmark task\". In many benchmark contexts, especially with numbers, the task could be to compute a summary statistic \u2014 perhaps the sum, product, average, or sort the list. Since no instruction is given, the most common default is to compute the sum. Let\u2019s compute the sum: 4 + 10 = 14, 14 + 7 = 21, 21 + 3 = 24. Alternatively, maybe it's to sort the list: [3, 4, 7, 10]. But without explicit instructions, sum is a reasonable guess. However, in some benchmarks, the task might be to find the maximum, minimum, or median. Let\u2019s consider: max = 10,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [4, 10, 7, 3], with no explicit instructions. In benchmark tasks with numeric lists and no tools, common objectives include computing sum, product, sorted order, max, min, or median. Since no instruction is given, the most standard default is to compute the sum. Calculating: 4 + 10 = 14; 14 + 7 = 21; 21 + 3 = 24. Alternative interpretations (e.g., sort \u2192 [3, 4, 7, 10], max = 10) are possible, but sum is the most typical default in arithmetic benchmarks. Given the lack of ambiguity in the task description and the absence of other guidance, sum = 24 is the most reasonable answer.",
