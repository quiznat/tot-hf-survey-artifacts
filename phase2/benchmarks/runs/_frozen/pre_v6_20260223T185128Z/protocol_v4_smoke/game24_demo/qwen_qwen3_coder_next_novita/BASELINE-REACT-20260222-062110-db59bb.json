    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [2, 10, 10, 3], and no tools are available. This suggests the task may be to compute something from the list, such as a mathematical operation (e.g., sum, product, average, etc.), or perhaps to recognize a pattern or solve a known puzzle (e.g., 24 game). Let\u2019s check if it\u2019s the 24 game: using 2, 10, 10, 3 to make 24.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 10 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 25 \u2192 too high.\n- (10 + 2) \u00d7 (3 - 10/10) = 12 \u00d7 (3 - 1) = 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 \u2192 works!  \n  Breakdown: 10/10 = 1",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The list [2, 10, 10, 3] can be used to make 24 via the expression: (10 + 2) \u00d7 (3 - 10/10) = 12 \u00d7 (3 - 1) = 12 \u00d7 2 = 24. This uses all four numbers exactly once with standard arithmetic operations. Since no tools are available and the task likely asks for a solution to the 24 game (a common benchmark), the answer is the valid expression or confirmation that 24 is achievable.",
