    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 4, 4, 8], and no tools are available. Since this is a benchmark task and no specific instructions are given, I need to infer what the task might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include: finding the sum, product, mean, median, mode, range, checking for duplicates, sorting, or solving a puzzle like making 24. Given the numbers [3, 4, 4, 8], a classic 24 game variant is plausible: can we use +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24? Let's test:\n\nTry: 8 \u00d7 (4 - 3/4) = 8 \u00d7 (4 - 0.75) = 8 \u00d7 3.25 = 26 \u2192 no  \nTry: (8 - 4) \u00d7 (4 + 3)",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's continue exploring the 24 game hypothesis with [3, 4, 4, 8]. Try (8 - 4) \u00d7 (4 + 3) = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28 \u2192 too high. Try 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, and we have two 4s left \u2014 can we neutralize them? 8 \u00d7 3 + (4 - 4) = 24 + 0 = 24 \u2192 valid! That uses all numbers: 8, 3, 4, 4. Expression: 8 \u00d7 3 + (4 - 4) = 24. Alternatively, (8 \u00f7 (4 - 3)) \u00d7 3? Wait, only one 3. Better: (8 \u00d7 4) - (4 \u00d7 3) = 32 - 12 = 20",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the 24 game exploration:  \nWe found 8 \u00d7 3 + (4 \u2212 4) = 24 + 0 = 24 \u2014 valid and uses all numbers exactly once.  \nAlternative: (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 3) = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28 (too high),  \n(8 \u00d7 4) \u2212 (4 \u00d7 3) = 32 \u2212 12 = 20,  \n8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4) = 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 also valid!  \nIndeed: 4 \u00f7 4 = 1, 4 \u2212 1 = 3, 8 \u00d7 3 = 24.

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: The benchmark task with input [3, 4, 4, 8] and no tools strongly suggests a \"Make 24\" puzzle. I have verified two valid expressions using all four numbers exactly once:  \n1. 8 \u00d7 3 + (4 \u2212 4) = 24  \n2. 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4) = 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24  \nBoth are correct. Since the task likely asks whether 24 can be made (or to produce such an expression), and multiple solutions exist, the answer is yes \u2014 and a clean solution is 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 4 \u00f7 4) = 24.",
