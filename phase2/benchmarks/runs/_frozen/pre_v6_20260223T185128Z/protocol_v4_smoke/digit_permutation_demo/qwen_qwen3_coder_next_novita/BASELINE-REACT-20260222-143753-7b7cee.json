Now check divisibility by 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 3336, last three digits are 336. 336 \u00f7 8 = 42 \u2192 exact, so 3336 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle_max is 3336, and it's a valid",

We verified that 3336 uses the correct digits and is divisible by 8 (since 336 \u00f7 8 = 42). Now, to confirm it's the *largest* such number, we consider all permutations of the digits in descending order: possible candidates starting with 6 (largest leading digit) would be 6336, 6336, 6336 (all same multiset), but 6336 > 3336.

Oracle_max is 3336, but we must verify if a larger valid number exists. Permutations starting with 6 (largest possible leading digit) give candidates like 6336. Check 6336: last three digits = 336; 336 \u00f7 8 = 42 \u2192 divisible. Digits of 6336 are [6, 3, 3, 6] \u2014 wait, that's two 6s and only two 3s, but our multiset is [6, 3, 3, 3] (one 6, three 3s). So 6336 is invalid (extra 6, missing a 3).",
