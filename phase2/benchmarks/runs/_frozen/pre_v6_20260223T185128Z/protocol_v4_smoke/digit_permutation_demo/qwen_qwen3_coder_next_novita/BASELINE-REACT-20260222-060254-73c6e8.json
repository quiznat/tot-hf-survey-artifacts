    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by 3 that can be formed using the digits [8, 1, 6, 0], with the constraint that the number must be \u2264 8610 (oracle_max). Since no tools are available, I need to solve this manually.\n\nFirst, recall: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\nDigits: 8, 1, 6, 0 \u2192 sum = 8 + 1 + 6 + 0 = 15, which is divisible by 3. So the largest permutation of all four digits that is \u2264 8610 and divisible by 3 is a candidate.\n\nList all permutations of [8,1,6,0] in descending order and check which is \u2264 8610 and divisible by 3.\n\nAll 4-digit permutations (no leading",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's continue systematically. Digits are [8, 1, 6, 0], sum = 15, divisible by 3, so any permutation of all four digits is divisible by 3. So we just need the largest permutation \u2264 8610.\n\nList permutations in descending order:\n\nStart with largest possible 4-digit number from these digits: arrange digits descending \u2192 8610. That's exactly the oracle_max.\n\nCheck: Is 8610 \u2264 8610? Yes. Is it divisible by 3? Sum = 8+6+1+0 = 15 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo 8610 itself satisfies all conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8610.",
