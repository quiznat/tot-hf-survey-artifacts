    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 3 that can be formed using the digits [8, 1, 6, 0]. The oracle_max is given as 8610, which suggests that 8610 is the correct answer, but I need to verify it.\n\nFirst, recall that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\nDigits: 8, 1, 6, 0 \u2192 sum = 8 + 1 + 6 + 0 = 15. 15 is divisible by 3, so any permutation of all four digits could potentially form a number divisible by 3.\n\nTo get the maximum number, we should arrange the digits in descending order: 8, 6, 1, 0 \u2192 8610.\n\nCheck: 8610 \u00f7 3 =",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me verify 8610 \u00f7 3.  \n8610 \u00f7 3 = 2870, which is an integer, so 8610 is indeed divisible by 3.  \nAlso, since the digit sum is 15 (divisible by 3), and 8610 is the largest possible permutation of [8,1,6,0], it must be the maximum number divisible by 3.  \nThus, the answer is confirmed.\nFINAL: 8610"
