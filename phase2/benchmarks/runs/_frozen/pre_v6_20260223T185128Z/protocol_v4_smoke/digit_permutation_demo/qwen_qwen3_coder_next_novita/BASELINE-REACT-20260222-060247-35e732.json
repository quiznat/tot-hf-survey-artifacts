    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (6) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [9, 1, 3, 8]. The oracle_max is 9318, which is likely the correct answer, but I need to verify.\n\nFirst, recall that a number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits from [9,1,3,8] are only 8 (since 8 is the only even digit).\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 21, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 all permutations are divisible by 3.\n\nSo, we only need to consider permutations ending in",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: So far, I've established that for a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. The sum of digits is 21, divisible by 3, so all permutations are divisible by 3. Only permutations ending in the even digit 8 will be divisible by 2, hence by 6. So the candidate numbers are all 4-digit numbers formed by permuting [9,1,3] in the first three positions and ending with 8. To maximize the number, we should arrange the remaining digits [9,1,3] in descending order: 9, 3, 1 \u2192 9318. This matches the oracle_max. So the answer is 9318.",
