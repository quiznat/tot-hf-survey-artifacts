    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by rearranging the digits [1, 9, 0, 8] such that the number is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 9810, which suggests that 9810 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if it's valid.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits from [1,9,0,8] are 0 or 8.\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 1 + 9 + 0 + 8 = 18, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 all permutations satisfy this.\n\nSo we only need to ensure the number ends in",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3. Sum of digits = 1+9+0+8 = 18, divisible by 3 \u2014 so all permutations satisfy divisibility by 3. For divisibility by 2, last digit must be even: only 0 or 8 are even digits available. To maximize the number, we want the largest possible digits in the highest places, so we prefer ending with 0 (since 8 < 9, but ending with 0 allows 9,8,1 before it). Let's list candidate max numbers ending with 0 or 8:\n\n- Ending with 0: arrange remaining digits [9,1,8] in descending order \u2192 9810  \n- Ending with 8: arrange remaining digits [9,1,0] in descending order \u2192 9108  \n\nCompare:",
