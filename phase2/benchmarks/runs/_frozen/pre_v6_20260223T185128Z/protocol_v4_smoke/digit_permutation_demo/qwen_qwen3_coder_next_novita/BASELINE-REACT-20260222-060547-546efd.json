    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by 3 that can be formed using the digits [8, 1, 6, 0], with the constraint that the number must be \u2264 8610 (oracle_max). Since no tools are available, I need to solve this manually.\n\nFirst, recall: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\nDigits: 8, 1, 6, 0 \u2192 sum = 8 + 1 + 6 + 0 = 15, which is divisible by 3. So the largest permutation of all four digits that is \u2264 8610 and divisible by 3 is a candidate.\n\nList all permutations of [8,1,6,0] in descending order and check which is \u2264 8610 and divisible by 3.\n\nAll 4-digit permutations (starting with",
