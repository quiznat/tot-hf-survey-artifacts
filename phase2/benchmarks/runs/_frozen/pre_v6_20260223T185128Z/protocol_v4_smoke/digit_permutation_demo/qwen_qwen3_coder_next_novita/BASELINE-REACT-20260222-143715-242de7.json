    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [6, 6, 8, 4]. The oracle_max is given as 8664, which suggests that 8664 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if it's indeed the maximum possible number divisible by 4 using those digits.\n\nA number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nDigits available: [6, 6, 8, 4]\n\nWe want the largest possible number \u2192 so we want digits in descending order as much as possible, but must satisfy divisibility by 4.\n\nAll permutations of digits in descending order: try 8664, 8646, 8466, 6864, etc.\n\nCheck 8664:",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: To verify if 8664 is valid: last two digits are '64', and 64 \u00f7 4 = 16 \u2192 divisible by 4. Digits used: 8, 6, 6, 4 \u2014 matches the input digits. So 8664 is a valid candidate.\n\nNow check if any larger permutation exists. The largest possible number from digits [6,6,8,4] is 8664 (since descending order: 8,6,6,4). Any other permutation would be smaller (e.g., 8646 < 8664, 8466 < 8664, etc.). So 8664 is indeed the maximum possible number, and it satisfies divisibility by 4.\n\nThus, the answer is 8664.\n\nFINAL: 8664"
