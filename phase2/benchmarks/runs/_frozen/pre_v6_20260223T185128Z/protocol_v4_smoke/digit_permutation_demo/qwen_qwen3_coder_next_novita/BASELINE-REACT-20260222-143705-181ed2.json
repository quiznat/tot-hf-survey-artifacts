    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (11) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [4, 2, 2, 4]. The oracle_max is given as 4422, which suggests that 4422 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if 4422 is indeed divisible by 11 and is the maximum possible such number.\n\nFirst, check if 4422 is divisible by 11. The divisibility rule for 11: subtract and add digits alternately and check if result is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 4422: (4 - 4 + 2 - 2) = 0, and 0 is divisible by 11 \u2192 yes, 4422 is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, check if it's the maximum possible number",
