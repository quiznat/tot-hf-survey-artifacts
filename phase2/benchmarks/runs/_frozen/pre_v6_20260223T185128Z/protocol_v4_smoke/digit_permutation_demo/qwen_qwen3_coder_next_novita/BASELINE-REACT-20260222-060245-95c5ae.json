    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (3) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [1, 3, 2, 9]. The oracle_max is 9321, which is the maximum possible number from those digits (9,3,2,1), but we need to verify if it's divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Sum of digits = 1+3+2+9 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3. Therefore, the largest possible number (9321) is divisible by 3, and since oracle_max is given as 9321, that must be the answer. Let's double-check: 9321 \u00f7 3 = 3",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (3) that can be formed by rearranging the digits [1, 3, 2, 9]. The sum of the digits is 1+3+2+9 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Since divisibility by 3 depends only on the digit sum, *every* permutation of these digits is divisible by 3. Therefore, the largest possible permutation \u2014 which is formed by sorting digits in descending order: 9, 3, 2, 1 \u2192 9321 \u2014 is divisible by 3. The oracle_max is given as 9321, confirming this is the maximum. So the answer is 9321.",
