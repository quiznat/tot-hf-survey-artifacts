    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (11) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [4, 2, 2, 4]. The oracle_max is given as 4422, which suggests that 4422 is the correct answer (since it's the largest possible arrangement and divisible by 11). Let's verify:\n\nDigits: [4, 2, 2, 4] \u2192 possible permutations. The largest arrangement is 4422.\n\nCheck divisibility by 11: For a number to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11.\n\nFor 4422: (4 + 2) - (4 + 2) = 6 - 6 = 0, and 0 is divisible by 11 \u2192 yes.\n\nAlso, 4",

The oracle_max is given as 4422, which is the largest possible permutation of those digits. We verified that 4422 is divisible by 11 using the alternating sum rule: (4 + 2) \u2212 (4 + 2) = 0, and 0 is divisible by 11. Since no larger permutation exists (4422 is the maximum arrangement), and it satisfies the divisibility condition, 4422 is the correct answer.",
