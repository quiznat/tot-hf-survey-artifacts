    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [2, 5, 7, 6]. The oracle_max is 7652, which is likely the maximum possible number formed by those digits (7652), but we need the largest *divisible by 4* number \u2264 7652 using those digits.\n\nRecall: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nWe need to consider all permutations of [2,5,7,6] (i.e., 4! = 24 numbers), sort them descending, and pick the first divisible by 4.\n\nLet\u2019s list permutations in descending order (starting from largest possible: 7652, then 7625, 7562, 752",
