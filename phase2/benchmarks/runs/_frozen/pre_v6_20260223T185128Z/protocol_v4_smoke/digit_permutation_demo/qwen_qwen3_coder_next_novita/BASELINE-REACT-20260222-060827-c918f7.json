    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by rearranging the digits [4, 2, 2, 4] that is divisible by 11, and the oracle says the maximum is 4422. Let's verify if 4422 is divisible by 11.\n\nDivisibility rule for 11: subtract and add digits alternately and check if result is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 4422: (4 - 4 + 2 - 2) = 0, and 0 is divisible by 11, so 4422 is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, is 4422 the maximum possible arrangement? The digits are [4, 4, 2, 2]. The largest possible arrangement is 4422, which is indeed the maximum permutation. Since it satisfies divisibility",

We verified that 4422 is divisible by 11 using the alternating sum rule: (4 - 4 + 2 - 2) = 0, and 0 is divisible by 11. Since 4422 is both the largest permutation and divisible by 11, and the oracle confirms the maximum is 4422, the answer is confirmed.",
