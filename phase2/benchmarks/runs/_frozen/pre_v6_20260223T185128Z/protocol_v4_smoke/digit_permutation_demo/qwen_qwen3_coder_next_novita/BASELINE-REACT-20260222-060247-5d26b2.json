    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [2, 5, 7, 6]. The oracle_max is 7652, which is likely the maximum possible number formed by those digits (7652), but we need the largest *divisible by 4* number \u2264 7652.\n\nRecall: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nWe have digits: [2, 5, 7, 6]. All permutations of these digits (4! = 24) are possible. Let's list permutations in descending order and check divisibility by 4.\n\nLargest possible number: 7652  \nCheck 7652: last two digits = 52 \u2192 52 \u00f7 4 =",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: 52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so 52 is divisible by 4. Therefore, 7652 is divisible by 4. Since 7652 is the largest possible number formed by the digits [2, 5, 7, 6] (as confirmed by the oracle_max), and it is divisible by 4, it must be the answer. No further checking needed.",
