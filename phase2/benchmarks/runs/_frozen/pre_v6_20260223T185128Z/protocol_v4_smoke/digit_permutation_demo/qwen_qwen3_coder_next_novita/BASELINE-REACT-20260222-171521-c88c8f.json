    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (11) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [4, 2, 2, 4]. The oracle_max is given as 4422, which suggests that 4422 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if 4422 is indeed divisible by 11 and is the largest possible such number.\n\nFirst, check if 4422 is divisible by 11. The divisibility rule for 11: subtract and add digits alternately and check if result is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 4422: (4 - 4 + 2 - 2) = 0 \u2192 0 is divisible by 11, so yes, 4422 is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, check if it's the largest possible number",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The digits are [4, 2, 2, 4]. To form the largest possible number, we should sort digits in descending order: 4, 4, 2, 2 \u2192 4422. We already verified 4422 is divisible by 11 (alternating sum = 0). Are there any larger permutations? No \u2014 4422 is the maximum permutation of those digits. So 4422 is indeed the largest number divisible by 11 that can be formed. The oracle_max matches this. Final answer is 4422.",
