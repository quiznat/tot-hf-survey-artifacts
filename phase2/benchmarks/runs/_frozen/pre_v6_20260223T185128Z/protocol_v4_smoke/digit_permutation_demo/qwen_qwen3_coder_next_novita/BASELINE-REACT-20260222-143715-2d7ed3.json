    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark problem involving digits [3, 0, 3, 0], divisor 5, and oracle_max 3300. Since no tools are available, this is likely a reasoning-only problem. The digits [3, 0, 3, 0] could form numbers like 3030, 3003, 3300, etc. The divisor is 5, so we\u2019re probably looking for a number formed by permuting these digits that is divisible by 5 and \u2264 3300 (since oracle_max = 3300). A number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5. We have digits [3, 0, 3, 0] \u2014 two 3s and two 0s. So possible last digits are only 0 (since no 5",
