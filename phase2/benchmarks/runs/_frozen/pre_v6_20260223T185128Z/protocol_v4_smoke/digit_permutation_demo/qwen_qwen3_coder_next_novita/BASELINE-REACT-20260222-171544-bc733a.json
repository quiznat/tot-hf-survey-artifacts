    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark problem using a ReAct loop. The input gives digits [3, 0, 3, 0], a divisor 5, and an oracle_max of 3300. Since no tools are available, this is likely a reasoning-only problem. The digits [3,0,3,0] could form numbers like 3030, or perhaps we need to insert digits into positions, or find a number divisible by 5 using those digits. Since divisor is 5, any number ending in 0 or 5 is divisible by 5. The digits include two 0s and two 3s, so numbers like 3300, 3030, 3003 (not divisible by 5), 0330 = 330, etc. 3300 is divisible by 5 (3",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The digits [3, 0, 3, 0] can be rearranged to form various 4-digit numbers. Since the divisor is 5, a number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5. We have two 0s and two 3s, so valid endings are 0. Possible numbers ending in 0: 3300, 3030, 0330 (=330), 0303 (=303, ends in 3 \u2192 invalid), 3003 (ends in 3 \u2192 invalid), 0033 (=33, ends in 3 \u2192 invalid). So valid candidates: 3300, 3030, 330. All are divisible by 5. The oracle_max is 3300, suggesting the answer may be the",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The digits [3, 0, 3, 0] can be rearranged to form numbers using all four digits (since it's a 4-digit list), so leading zeros would reduce the digit count (e.g., 0330 = 330 is a 3-digit number), but the problem may allow leading zeros if not specified otherwise. However, the oracle_max is 3300, which is one of the valid permutations (3300) and is divisible by 5. Since 3300 is the largest possible number formed by these digits (3300 > 3030 > 330), and it's divisible by 5, and matches the oracle_max, it's likely the target. The task probably asks for the largest number \u2264 oracle_max that is divisible by the divisor and uses the given digits exactly once each. 33",

Permutations using all four digits: 3300, 3030, 3003, 0330, 0303, 0033. Interpreting as integers: 3300, 3030, 3003, 330, 303, 33.
