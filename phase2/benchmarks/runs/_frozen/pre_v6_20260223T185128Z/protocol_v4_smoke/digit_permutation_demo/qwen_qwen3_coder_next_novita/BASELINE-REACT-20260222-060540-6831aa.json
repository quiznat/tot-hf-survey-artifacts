    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [6, 6, 8, 4].

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The largest possible number from digits [6, 6, 8, 4] is 8664 (since digits sorted descending: 8, 6, 6, 4). We verified 8664 is divisible by 4 because its last two digits, 64, form 64 \u00f7 4 = 16 (integer). Any larger permutation would require a higher digit in the thousands place, but 8 is the largest digit, and among numbers starting with 8, 8664 is the highest arrangement (next would be 8646, which is smaller). So 8664 is indeed the maximum divisible by 4. The oracle_max matches this, confirming correctness. No further checks needed.",
