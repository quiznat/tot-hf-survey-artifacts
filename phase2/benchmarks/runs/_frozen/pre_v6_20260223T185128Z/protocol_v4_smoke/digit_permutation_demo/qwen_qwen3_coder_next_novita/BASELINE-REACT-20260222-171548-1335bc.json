    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [6, 6, 8, 4]. The oracle_max is 8664, which suggests that 8664 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible arrangement and divisible by 4). Let's verify:  \n- Digits: 6, 6, 8, 4 \u2192 possible permutations.  \n- To be divisible by 4, the last two digits must form a number divisible by 4.  \n- Try largest possible number: 8664. Last two digits: 64 \u2192 64 \u00f7 4 = 16 \u2192 divisible by 4.  \n- Is there a larger permutation? Next would be 8646 \u2192 last two digits 46 \u2192 46 \u00f7 4",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 4 that can be formed using the digits [6, 6, 8, 4]. The oracle_max is given as 8664, which is likely the correct answer, but I should verify it properly. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 8664, the last two digits are 64, and 64 \u00f7 4 = 16, so it's divisible by 4. Now, is there any larger permutation? The digits sorted descending are [8, 6, 6, 4], giving 8664 \u2014 that's the largest possible arrangement. Any other permutation would be smaller (e.g., 8646, 8466, etc.). So 8664 is indeed the maximum divisible by",

To verify:  \n- The largest possible arrangement of the digits is 8664 (digits sorted descending: 8, 6, 6, 4).  \n- A number is divisible by 4 iff its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 8664, last two digits are 64, and 64 \u00f7 4 = 16 \u2192 divisible.  \n- Since 8664 is the largest possible permutation and satisfies divisibility, it is the answer. No larger permutation exists.  \nThus, the final answer is 8664.",
