    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [6, 3, 3, 3] that is divisible by 8, and the oracle_max is given as 3336. Let's verify if 3336 is valid: digits of 3336 are [3, 3, 3, 6] \u2014 matches the multiset [6, 3, 3, 3]. Now check divisibility by 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 3336, last three digits are 336. 336 \u00f7 8 = 42 \u2192 exact, so 3336 is divisible by 8. Is there a larger number possible? The digits sorted descending: 6,3,3,3 \u2192 largest",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The digits [6, 3, 3, 3] can form numbers up to 6333 as the largest permutation. But 6333 is odd, and divisibility by 8 requires the last three digits to form a number divisible by 8. Let\u2019s check possible permutations in descending order to find the maximum divisible by 8. The oracle_max is 3336, but is that the maximum? Let's verify larger candidates:\n\n- 6336: digits [6,3,3,6] \u2014 but we only have one 6, so invalid.\n- 6333: digits [6,3,3,3] \u2014 valid multiset.
