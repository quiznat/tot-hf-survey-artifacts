    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations in two variables: a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) -8x - 9y = -82  \n2) 7x - 7y = 42  \n\nWe need to solve this system of equations. Let's simplify and solve step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify equation (2): divide both sides by 7 \u2192 x - y = 6 \u2192 x = y + 6.\n\nSubstitute x = y + 6 into equation (1):\n-8(y + 6) - 9y = -82  \n\u2192 -8y - 48 - 9y = -82  \n\u2192 -17y - 48 = -82  \n\u2192 -17y = -82 + 48 = -3",
