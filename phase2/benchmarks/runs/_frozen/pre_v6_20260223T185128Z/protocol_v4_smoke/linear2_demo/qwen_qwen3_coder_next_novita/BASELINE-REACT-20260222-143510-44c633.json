    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of two equations, each represented as a list of three numbers: [[-6, -7, -6], [-8, 1, -8]]. Since no tools are available, I need to interpret what these equations represent. Typically, a list of three numbers [a, b, c] could represent a linear equation in two variables: a\u00b7x + b\u00b7y = c, or possibly a quadratic or other form. Given the context of benchmark tasks, it's common to interpret [a, b, c] as coefficients of a linear equation: a*x + b*y = c.\n\nSo we have:\n1) -6x - 7y = -6  \n2) -8x + 1y = -8\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations.\n\nLet me write them more cleanly:\nEquation (1): -6x - 7y = -6",
