    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations of the form ax + by = c. We have two equations:  \n1) 8x + 8y = -16  \n2) -5x + 8y = 62  \n\nWe need to solve this system of two linear equations for x and y. Let's solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify equation (1):  \n8x + 8y = -16 \u2192 divide both sides by 8:  \nx + y = -2  \u2192 equation (1a)\n\nNow, equation (2):  \n-5x + 8y = 62\n\nWe can use substitution or elimination. From (1a), x = -2 - y. Substitute into (2):\n\n-5(-2 - y) + 8y = 62  \n\u2192",

Let's verify in both original equations:  \n\nEquation 1: 8x + 8y = 8(-6) + 8(4) = -48 + 32 = -16 \u2713  \nEquation 2: -5x + 8y = -5(-6) + 8(4) = 30 + 32 =",
