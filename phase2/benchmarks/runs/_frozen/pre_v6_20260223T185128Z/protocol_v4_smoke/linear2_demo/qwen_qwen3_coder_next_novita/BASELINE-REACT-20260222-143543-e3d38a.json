    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations of the form ax + by = c. We have two equations:  \n1) 8x + 8y = -16  \n2) -5x + 8y = 62  \n\nWe need to solve this system of two linear equations with two variables (x and y). Let's solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify equation (1):  \n8x + 8y = -16 \u2192 divide both sides by 8:  \nx + y = -2  \u2192 Equation (1a)\n\nNow, equation (2):  \n-5x + 8y = 62\n\nWe can use substitution or elimination. From (1a), x = -2 - y. Substitute into (2):\n\n-5(-2 - y) + 8y = 62",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the solution:  \n-5(-2 - y) + 8y = 62  \n\u2192 10 + 5y + 8y = 62  \n\u2192 10 + 13y = 62  \n\u2192 13y = 52  \n\u2192 y = 4  \n\nNow substitute y = 4 into x = -2 - y:  \nx = -2 - 4 = -6  \n\nSo the solution is x = -6, y = 4. Let's verify:  \nEquation (1): 8(-6) + 8(4) = -48 + 32 = -16 \u2713  \nEquation (2): -5(-6) + 8(4) = 30 + 32 = 62 \u2713  \n\nThe system is consistent and has a unique solution.  \nFINAL: x = -"
