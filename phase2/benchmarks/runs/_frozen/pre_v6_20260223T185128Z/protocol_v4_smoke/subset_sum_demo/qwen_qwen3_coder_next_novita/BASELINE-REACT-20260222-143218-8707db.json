    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 57 using the list of numbers [5, 14, 19, 19, 19] with no tools available. Since no operations are specified, I assume standard arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) are allowed, and each number can be used at most once.\n\nWe have three 19s \u2014 that's promising because 19 \u00d7 3 = 57. Indeed, 19 + 19 + 19 = 57. That uses exactly three of the numbers: 19, 19, 19.\n\nWe have leftover numbers: 5 and 14, but the problem doesn\u2019t say we must use *all* numbers \u2014 only that we must reach the target using the given numbers (typically in such puzzles, you *can* use a subset unless stated otherwise",
