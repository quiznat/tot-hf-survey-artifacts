    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24] and a target: 62. We need to find a combination (likely using arithmetic operations) to reach 62. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning puzzle \u2014 possibly using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, concatenation, or exponentiation, but typically in such benchmarks, basic arithmetic and possibly parentheses are allowed.\n\nLet\u2019s explore sums first:\n- Sum of all numbers: 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 = 86 \u2192 too high.\n- Try subsets:\n  - 24 + 22 = 46; 62 - 46 = 16 \u2192 do we have 16? No, but 14 + 2 =",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let\u2019s continue exploring combinations. Sum of all numbers is 86, which is 24 more than 62. So maybe removing some numbers that sum to 24 could work: 24 itself is in the list, so sum of others = 86 - 24 = 62! Wait: 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 = let's compute: 2+6=8, 8+14=22, 22+18=40, 40+22=62. Yes! So the subset [2, 6, 14, 18, 22] sums to 62. That\u2019s a valid solution using only addition.",
