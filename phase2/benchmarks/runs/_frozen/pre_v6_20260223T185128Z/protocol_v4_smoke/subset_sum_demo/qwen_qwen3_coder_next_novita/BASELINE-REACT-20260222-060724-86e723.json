    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24] and a target: 62. We need to find a combination (likely using arithmetic operations) that yields 62. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning puzzle \u2014 likely using addition/subtraction/multiplication/division, possibly using each number at most once.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possible combinations.\n\nFirst, sum all numbers:  \n2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 =  \n2+6=8, +14=22, +18=40, +22=62, +24=86 \u2192 total = 86.\n\nWe need 62, which is 86 \u2212 24 = 62.

Let's verify: 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 = ?  \n2+6=8, 8+14=22, 22+18=40, 40+22=62. Yes! So the subset [2, 6, 14, 18, 22] sums to 62. That\u2019s a valid solution using addition only, using each number at most once. No need for other operations.",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: We found that the sum of [2, 6, 14, 18, 22] is exactly 62, which matches the target. This uses five of the six numbers, each once, with only addition. Since the task likely expects a valid expression or subset achieving the target, this is a correct solution. No further reasoning or tools needed.\nFINAL: 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 = 62"
