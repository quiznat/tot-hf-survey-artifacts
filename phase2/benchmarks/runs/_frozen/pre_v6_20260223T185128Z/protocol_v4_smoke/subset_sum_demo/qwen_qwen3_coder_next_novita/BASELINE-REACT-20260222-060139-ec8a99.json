Let's explore combinations.\n\nWe have three 19s \u2014 that's promising because 19 \u00d7 3 = 57. Indeed, 19 + 19 + 19 = 57. That uses three numbers, but we have five numbers: [5, 14, 19, 19, 19]. Do we need to use all numbers? In many \"make target\" puzzles (e.g., Countdown), you must use *some* of the numbers, not necessarily all \u2014 but sometimes the rule is to use all. Since",

A key observation: 19 + 19 + 19 = 57 exactly. That uses three of the five numbers. In many such puzzles (e.g., Countdown), it's acceptable to use a subset of the numbers, not necessarily all. Since the target is achieved with just the three 19s, and no further constraints are specified requiring use of all numbers, this is a valid solution. Let's verify: 19 + 19 + 19 = 57 \u2714\ufe0f.
