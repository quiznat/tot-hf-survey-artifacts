    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 50 using the given list of numbers [2, 10, 10, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25] and basic arithmetic operations (since no tools are available, I assume standard operations like +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses are allowed). This resembles the \"24 game\" or similar target-number puzzles.\n\nWe need to find a combination of these numbers (each used at most once, unless duplicates are allowed \u2014 here we have two 10s, so we can use 10 twice) and operations to get 50.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possibilities.\n\nFirst, check if any simple sums work:\n- 25 + 24 = 49 \u2192 need +1 \u2192 we have 2, but 49 + 2 = 51 (too much",
