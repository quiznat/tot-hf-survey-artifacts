    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to use the numbers [1, 4, 8, 9, 9, 10, 16, 21] to reach the target 30. Since no tools are available, this is likely a puzzle where we need to combine numbers using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, possibly concatenation or exponentiation) \u2014 but the problem statement doesn\u2019t specify allowed operations. In many such benchmarks (e.g., Countdown numbers game), standard operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) are assumed, and each number may be used at most once.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a combination:\n\nWe have: [1, 4, 8, 9, 9, 10, 16, 21], target = 30.\n\nFirst, look for obvious combinations:\n\n- 21 + 9 = 3",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's continue exploring combinations. 21 + 9 = 30 \u2014 that\u2019s exactly the target! But we have two 9s, so using one 9 and 21 gives 30. That uses only two numbers: 21 and 9. Are we required to use all numbers? The problem statement doesn\u2019t specify. In many benchmark tasks (e.g., \"use some or all numbers\"), if not specified, using a subset is acceptable \u2014 especially since using all 8 numbers to make 30 would be unusually constrained without explicit instructions.\n\nCheck: 21 + 9 = 30 \u2705  \nWe have at least one 9 in the list \u2192 yes, available.\n\nThus, a valid solution is: 21 + 9 = 30.\n\nNo need for more steps. Final answer.\n\n\nFINAL: 21 + 9 = 30"
