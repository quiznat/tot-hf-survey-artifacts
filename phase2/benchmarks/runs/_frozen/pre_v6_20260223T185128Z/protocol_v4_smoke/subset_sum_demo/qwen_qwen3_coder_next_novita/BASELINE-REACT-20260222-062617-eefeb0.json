    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 57 using the list of numbers [5, 14, 19, 19, 19] with no tools available.

Indeed, 19 + 19 + 19 = 57. That uses exactly three of the numbers: 19, 19, 19.\n\nThe remaining numbers are 5 and 14, but since the target is achieved with just the three 19s, and the problem doesn\u2019t require using *all* numbers (unless implied), we should verify if all numbers must be used.\n\nThe task",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 57 using the list of numbers [5, 14, 19, 19, 19] with standard arithmetic operations, each number used at most once. Since 19 + 19 + 19 = 57, and this uses exactly three of the five numbers, we need to determine whether *all* numbers must be used. In most such puzzles (e.g., Countdown numbers game), *all* numbers must be used exactly once. The presence of extra numbers (5 and 14) suggests they likely must be incorporated. So using only three 19s may not be sufficient unless explicitly allowed. Let\u2019s test if we can incorporate all numbers.\n\nWe need an expression using [5, 14, 19, 19, 19] to equal 57.\n\nTry: (19",

Since 19 \u00d7 3 = 57, and we have three 19s, the challenge is to incorporate 5 and 14 without changing the value. One common trick is to create a multiplicative identity (\u00d71) or additive identity (+0). Let\u2019s see: (14 \u2212 5) = 9. Can we use 9 to form a factor of 1? Not directly.
