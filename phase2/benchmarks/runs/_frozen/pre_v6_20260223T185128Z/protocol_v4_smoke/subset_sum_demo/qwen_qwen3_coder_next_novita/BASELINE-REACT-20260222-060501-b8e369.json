    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 50 using the given list of numbers [2, 10, 10, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25] with no tools available. Since no operations are specified, I assume standard arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) are allowed, and each number can be used at most once. This resembles the \"24 game\" or similar target-sum/combination puzzles.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations:\n\nWe need to reach 50.\n\nTry summing some numbers:\n- 25 + 24 = 49 \u2192 +2 = 51 (too high), 49 + 10 = 59, 49 + 2 = 51, 49 + (10\u221210) = 49.\n- 25",

So: 25 + 24 + (10 / 10) = 49 + 1 = 50. All numbers used? We used 25, 24, 10, 10 \u2014 that\u2019s four numbers. Remaining numbers (2,18,19,22) are unused, but the problem doesn\u2019t state we must use *all* numbers \u2014 only that each used number is used at most once. In typical target-number puzzles (e.g., Countdown), you don\u2019t have to use all numbers, just some",
