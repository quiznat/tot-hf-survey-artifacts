    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24], and a target: 62. We need to find a combination (likely using arithmetic operations) to reach the target. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning puzzle \u2014 possibly using addition/subtraction/multiplication/division, maybe using each number at most once.\n\nLet\u2019s explore sums first:\n\nTotal sum of all numbers: 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 =  \n2+6=8, +14=22, +18=40, +22=62, +24=86.  \nInteresting: sum of first five numbers (2+6+14+18+22) = 62 exactly!  \nCheck: 2",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: We are given numbers [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24] and target 62. Sum of all six numbers is 86, but sum of first five: 2 + 6 = 8; 8 + 14 = 22; 22 + 18 = 40; 40 + 22 = 62. Yes! 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 = 62. That uses five numbers, leaving out 24. So a valid combination is the sum of those five numbers. Since the task likely allows using a subset (standard in such puzzles unless specified otherwise), this satisfies the target. No operations beyond addition needed. Final answer is the expression or just confirmation. Since the instruction says \"FINAL: <answer>\", and the task"
