    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a way to reach the target number 21 using the given numbers [8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 25]. Since no tools are available, this is likely a puzzle where we need to combine numbers using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) \u2014 possibly using each number at most once.\n\nLet\u2019s examine possible combinations:\n\nWe want 21.\n\nCheck differences from target:\n- 25 - 21 = 4 \u2192 do we have 4? No.\n- 19 + 2 = 21 \u2192 do we have 2? Not directly, but 12 - 8 = 4, 13 - 11 = 2 \u2192 yes! So: 19 + (13 - 11) = 19 + 2 =",

This is a valid solution using only addition and subtraction. No need for other numbers. So the expression is valid and reaches the target.",
