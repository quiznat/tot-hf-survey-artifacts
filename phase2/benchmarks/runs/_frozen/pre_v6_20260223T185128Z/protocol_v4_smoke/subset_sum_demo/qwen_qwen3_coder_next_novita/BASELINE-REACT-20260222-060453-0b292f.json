    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: We need to reach 39 using numbers [2, 6, 7, 21, 23, 24] with arithmetic operations. A promising candidate: 24 + 21 = 45, and 45 - 6 = 39. So 24 + 21 - 6 = 39. This uses three numbers: 24, 21, and 6 \u2014 all present in the list. Since the task doesn\u2019t explicitly require using *all* numbers (and standard \"make target\" puzzles often allow subset usage unless stated otherwise), this is a valid solution. Let\u2019s verify: 24 + 21 = 45; 45 - 6 = 39. Correct. No need for other numbers. So the expression is valid.",
