We need to find a way to reach 62 using these numbers, likely via arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, possibly concatenation or exponentiation \u2014 but since no tools are specified, and it's a benchmark task, standard arithmetic is assumed). Let's explore combinations.\n\nFirst, sum all numbers:  \n2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 =  \n2+6=8, 8+14=22, 22+18=40, 40+22=62, 62+24=86 \u2192 total = 86. Too high.\n\nWe need 62, which is",

So if we can subtract 24 (i.e., exclude 24), the sum of the rest is 86 \u2212 24 = 62. Let's verify: 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 = ?  \n2+6=8, 8+14=22, 22+18=40, 40+22=62. Yes!
