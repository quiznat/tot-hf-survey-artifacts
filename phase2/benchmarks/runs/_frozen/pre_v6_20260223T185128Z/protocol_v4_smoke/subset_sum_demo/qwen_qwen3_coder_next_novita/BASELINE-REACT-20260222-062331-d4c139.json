Since no tools are available, this is likely a puzzle where we need to combine numbers using arithmetic operations \u2014 possibly using each number at most once. I observed that 21 + 9 = 30, and since there are two 9s in the list, this is valid. So a solution exists using just two numbers: 21 and one of the 9s. No further steps needed \u2014 the answer is the expression or the numbers used. Since the task likely expects the solution expression or confirmation, I'll state the final answer.\nFINAL: 21 + 9 = 30"
