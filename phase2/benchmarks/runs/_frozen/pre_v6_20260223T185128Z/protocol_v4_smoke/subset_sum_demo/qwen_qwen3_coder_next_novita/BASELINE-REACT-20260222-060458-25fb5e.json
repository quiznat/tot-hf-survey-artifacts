    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24] and a target: 62. We need to find a combination (likely using arithmetic operations) to reach 62. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning puzzle \u2014 possibly using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, concatenation, or exponentiation, but typically in such benchmarks, basic arithmetic and possibly parentheses are allowed.\n\nLet\u2019s explore sums first:\n- Sum of all numbers: 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 = 86 \u2192 too high.\n- Try subsets:\n  - 24 + 22 + 18 = 64 \u2192 close, 64 - 2 = 62 \u2192 but 6 and 14 unused.\n  - 2",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's continue exploring combinations. We saw 24 + 22 + 18 = 64, and 64 \u2212 2 = 62, but that leaves 6 and 14 unused \u2014 not acceptable unless we can incorporate them in a neutral way (e.g., \u00d71 or +0). Alternatively, maybe (24 + 22 + 18) \u2212 (6 \u2212 4) but 4 isn\u2019t available.\n\nTry other subsets:\n- 24 + 22 + 14 = 60 \u2192 need +2 \u2192 60 + 2 = 62, and 6 and 18 left.

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Let's try a more systematic approach. Consider possible combinations using multiplication, since 62 is relatively large and the numbers are moderate.\n\nCheck if any product plus/minus something works:\n- 2 \u00d7 24 = 48 \u2192 62 \u2212 48 = 14 \u2192 we have 14! So 2 \u00d7 24 + 14 = 62. Remaining numbers: 6, 18, 22. Can we neutralize them? For example, (18 \u2212 18) = 0, but only one 18. Alternatively, (22 \u2212 22) = 0, but only one 22.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe we don\u2019t need to use *all* numbers?

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: In standard \"make the target\" puzzles (like Countdown or 24 game), it's typical to use *some* of the given numbers (not necessarily all), combined with basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7) and parentheses. We found: 2 \u00d7 24 + 14 = 48 + 14 = 62. That uses numbers 2, 24, and 14 \u2014 all present in the list [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24].
