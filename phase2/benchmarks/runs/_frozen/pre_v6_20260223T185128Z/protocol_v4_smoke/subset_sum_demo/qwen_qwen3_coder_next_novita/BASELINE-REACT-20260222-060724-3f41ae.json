From the reasoning above, two valid pairs exist: (17, 20) and (18, 19). Since the problem likely expects any one valid pair (or possibly all), and given the benchmark context, the simplest answer is to report one such pair. Let's confirm: 17 + 20 = 37, and both numbers are present. Also, 18 + 19 = 37, and since 19 appears twice, it's valid to use one instance of 19 with 18. Either is acceptable. I'll choose (17, 20) as the first",
