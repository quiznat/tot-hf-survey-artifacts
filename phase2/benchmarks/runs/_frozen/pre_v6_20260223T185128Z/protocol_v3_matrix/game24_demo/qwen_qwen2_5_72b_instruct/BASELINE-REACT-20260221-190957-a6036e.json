    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The attempt to use the `calc` tool with the input \"sum(4, 5, 9, 10)\" resulted in an error due to the expression being considered unsafe. I need to try a different approach that adheres to the tool's safety constraints. Instead of using a single command for the sum, I can break it down into multiple steps.\n\nACTION: calc \"4 + 5\"\nACTION: calc \"9 + 10\"\nACTION: calc \"9 + 19\"\n\nFINAL: 28",

I'll start by adding the first two numbers, then add the result to the next number, and continue this process until all numbers are added together.\n\nACTION: calc \"4 + 5\"\nACTION: calc \"9 + 9\"\nACTION: calc \"18 + 10\"\n\nFINAL: 28\nSTEP 3 MODEL: THINK: To ensure the calculations are done step-by-step and within the constraints of the `calc` tool, I will perform each addition individually and keep track of the intermediate results.\n\nACTION: calc \"4 + 5\"\nACTION: calc \"9 + 9\"\nACTION: calc \"18 + 10\"\n\nFINAL: 28\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: 9\nSTEP 4 MODEL",
