Since no specific task has been mentioned, and we have an array [2, 5, 6, 6] as input, I will assume that the task might be to perform some basic operation like summing up the elements or finding the maximum value in the array. However, without more context, I'll start by calculating the sum of the elements as a reasonable first step.\nACTION: calc 2 + 5 + 6 + 6",
