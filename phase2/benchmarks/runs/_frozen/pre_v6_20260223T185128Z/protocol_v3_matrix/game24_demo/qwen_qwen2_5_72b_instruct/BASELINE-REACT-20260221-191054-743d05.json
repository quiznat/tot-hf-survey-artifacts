    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is not clearly defined. I need to understand what kind of operation or result is expected from the given input [2, 2, 8, 8]. Since there is only one available tool (calc), and it's typically used for mathematical operations, I will assume that some form of calculation is required. However, without more context, I cannot determine which specific operation to perform. I will start by considering basic operations such as sum, product, or average.\n\nACTION: calc \"sum(2, 2, 8, 8)\"",

Instead, I should try performing the calculation in a different format that the `calc` tool can handle. I will start with a simple addition operation.\n\nACTION: calc \"2 + 2 + 8 + 8\"",
