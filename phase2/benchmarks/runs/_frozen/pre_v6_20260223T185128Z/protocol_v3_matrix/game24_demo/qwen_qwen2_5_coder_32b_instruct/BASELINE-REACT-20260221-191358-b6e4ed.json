Since I only have access to a calculator tool, I should try to use it to perform calculations that might help solve this problem. The most logical approach would be to try different arithmetic operations with these numbers to see if I can reach a meaningful result or identify a pattern.\n\nLet me start by trying some basic operations.\n\nACTION: calc 4 + 4 + 4 + 10\n\nScratchpad:",

However, without additional context about what specific task needs to be solved with these numbers, I should consider if there's a more meaningful mathematical relationship or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try some other operations that might be relevant:\n- Looking at 4, 4, 4 as three identical numbers and 10 as a fourth number\n- Considering if this relates to exponents or other operations\n- Trying to find a pattern or relationship between the numbers\n\nLet me try calculating 4^4 + 10, which would be 256 + 10 = 266.\n\nACTION: calc 4 ** 4 + 10\n\nScratchpad",

Perhaps the task involves finding a way to combine these numbers to get a specific target value, or maybe it's about identifying a mathematical relationship.\n\nLet me try one more approach -",

Since no specific operation or goal was provided in the task description, I should make a reasonable assumption about what needs to be done.\n\nGiven that I've already tried sum, product, and exponentiation operations without clear direction, let me think about whether there's a standard benchmark task that uses such inputs. Often, these types of problems ask for a specific calculation or pattern recognition.\n\nSince I cannot determine the exact task from the information given, and the most straightforward interpretation would be to compute some meaningful combination of these numbers, I'll go with the sum as it's the most basic and commonly requested operation.\n\nFINAL: 22"
