Let me start by trying some basic calculations.\n\nACTION: calc 4 + 4 + 4 + 9\n\nTHINK: I calculated the sum of all numbers, but let me try other operations that might be more meaningful for this type of benchmark task.

The most straightforward interpretation would be to combine them in a way that produces a single meaningful number. Since the task doesn't specify exactly what to compute, I'll go with the simplest operation that uses all numbers: addition. This gives us 21.\n\nFINAL: 21",

Since no specific operation was mentioned, I should look for the most mathematically significant result or the one that follows a clear pattern.
