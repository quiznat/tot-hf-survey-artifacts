    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task using the available tools. The task input is [3, 8, 10, 10] and I only have access to a calculator tool called \"calc\". Since there's no specific instruction on what to do with these numbers, I should first try to understand what operation might be most relevant. Looking at the numbers, I could calculate their sum, which seems like a basic but reasonable approach.\n\nACTION: calc 3 + 8 + 10 + 10\n\nFINAL: 31",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I've calculated the sum of the numbers [3, 8, 10, 10] and got 31. Since the task doesn't specify a particular operation to perform, calculating the sum is a logical first step. The calculation has been completed successfully, so I can provide the final answer.\n\nFINAL: 31"
