    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [2, 7, 8, 9], and the only available tool is `calc`.

Common benchmark tasks with a list of numbers include computing the sum, product, or perhaps forming a specific expression (e.g., using all numbers once with operations to reach a target like 24).
