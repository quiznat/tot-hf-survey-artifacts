    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [2, 2, 6, 6], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the numbers [2, 2, 6, 6] with arithmetic operations to reach 24 (a common benchmark). Let me try to find an expression using these numbers that evaluates to 24.\n\nPossible approaches:\n- 6 \u00d7 6 = 36; 36 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 = 32 \u2192 too high\n- 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 16 \u2192 too low\n- (6 + 6) \u00d7 (2 + 2) = 12 \u00d7 4 = 48 \u2192 too high\n- 6 \u00d7 (2 + 2) +",

Since 6 \u00d7 2 = 12, and we have two 6s and two 2s, maybe (6 + 6) \u00d7 2 \u2212 2 = 12 \u00d7 2 \u2212 2 = 24 \u2212 2 = 22 \u2014 close. What about 6 \u00d7 (6 \u2212 2/2)? That would be 6 \u00d7 (6 \u2212 1) = 6 \u00d7 5 = 30 \u2014 too high. Try (6 \u00d7 6) \u2212 (2 \u00d7 2) = 36 \u2212 4 = 32. Hmm. How about (6 + 2) \u00d7 (6 \u2212 2) = 8 \u00d7 4 = 32 again. Wait \u2014 what about 6 \u00d7 2 + 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 + 12 = 24!",
