    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [2, 3, 3, 6], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation or goal is given, I need to infer what the task might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing the sum, product, mean, or checking for some property (e.g., can we make 24 using arithmetic operations?). Given the numbers [2, 3, 3, 6], a classic 24 game variant is plausible.\n\nLet\u2019s test if we can make 24 using these numbers and basic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses). Try:  \n6 \u00f7 (1 \u2212 3/3) = 6 \u00f7 (1 \u2212 1) \u2192 division by zero \u2014 no.  \nTry: (3 + 3) \u00d7 (6 \u2212",

Let\u2019s try to find such an expression.\n\nTry:  \n(6 \u00f7 (3 \u2212 3/2))  \n\u2192 3/2 = 1.5  \n\u2192 3 \u2212 1.5 = 1.5  \n\u2192 6 \u00f7 1.5 = 4 \u2014 not 24.\n\nTry: (6 \u00d7 3) + (3 \u00d7 2) = 18 + 6 = 24 \u2014 yes!
