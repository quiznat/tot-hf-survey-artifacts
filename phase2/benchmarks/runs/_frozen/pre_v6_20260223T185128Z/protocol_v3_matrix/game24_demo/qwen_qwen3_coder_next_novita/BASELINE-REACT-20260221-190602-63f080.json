    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [4, 5, 9, 10]. I need to determine what operation to perform using the available tool `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, I should consider common benchmark tasks \u2014 perhaps summing the numbers, finding a pattern, or computing something like total, average, or product. Let me try computing the sum first, as it's the most straightforward.\n\nACTION: calc 4 + 5 + 9 + 10",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the numbers [4, 5, 9, 10] is 28. Since the task didn\u2019t specify an operation, and summing is a common default for such lists, this is a reasonable answer. I should verify if any other interpretation makes sense \u2014 e.g., average would be 7, product is 1800, but without further context, sum is simplest and most likely intended. I\u2019ll go with 28.\nFINAL: 28"
