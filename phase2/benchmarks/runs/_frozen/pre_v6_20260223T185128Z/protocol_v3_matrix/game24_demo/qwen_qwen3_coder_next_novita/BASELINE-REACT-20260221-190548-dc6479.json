    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [1, 6, 6, 6], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer what the goal might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve computing some aggregate (e.g., sum, product, mean), or perhaps forming an expression to reach a target (like 24 game). Given [1, 6, 6, 6], a classic puzzle is to make 24 using all numbers exactly once with basic operations. Let\u2019s test that hypothesis.\n\nTry: 6 \u00d7 (6 \u2212 1) \u2212 6 = 6 \u00d7 5 \u2212 6 = 30 \u2212 6 = 24. Yes! That uses all numbers: 6, 6, 1, 6.\n\nSo the expression is: 6",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input [1, 6, 6, 6] suggests a classic \"make 24\" puzzle. I found a valid expression: 6 \u00d7 (6 \u2212 1) \u2212 6 = 24, using all numbers exactly once. To confirm correctness, I should compute it using the `calc` tool. The expression is `6 * (6 - 1) - 6`. Let me evaluate it.\nACTION: calc 6 * (6 - 1) - 6",
