    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop with input [3, 3, 6, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to combine the numbers [3, 3, 6, 7] using arithmetic operations to reach a target (e.g., 24 game). Let me try to find an expression using all four numbers exactly once to reach 24.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- 7 - 3 = 4; 6 / 3 = 2; 4 * 6 = 24? Wait, need to use all four numbers.\n- Try: (7 - 3) * (6) = 24, but that uses only 7, 3, 6 \u2014 missing one 3.\n- Try: (7 - 3/3) *",

I need to find a valid expression. Let me explore systematically.\n\nTry:  \n- 7 \u00d7 3 = 21, need +3 \u2192 but 6 remains, not 3.  \n- 6 \u00d7 3 = 18, need +6 \u2192 but only one 6 and two 3s: 18 + 3 + 3 = 24 \u2192 yes! That uses 6, 3, 3, and... wait, 6 \u00d7 3 + 3 + 3 = 18 + 6 = 24, but that uses three 3s and one 6 \u2014 we have only two 3s. So",
