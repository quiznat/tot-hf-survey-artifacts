    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what operations are needed.

Maybe it's not simple arithmetic but something else.\n\nLooking more carefully at [9, 6,",

Let me try multiplication with adjustments:\n\n9 \u00d7 6 = 54, which is 6 more than 48\nOr maybe: 9 \u00d7 (6 - something) = 48\n9 \u00d7 6 = 54, and 54 - 6 = 48\n\nWait, let me reconsider if there's a different pattern. What if it's (a + b) \u00d7 some factor?\n(9 + 6) = 15, and 15 \u00d7 3.2 = 48? That seems arbitrary.\n\nLet me look at the second equation [-7, 5, 40]:\n(-7) \u00d7 5 = -35, which is 7",
