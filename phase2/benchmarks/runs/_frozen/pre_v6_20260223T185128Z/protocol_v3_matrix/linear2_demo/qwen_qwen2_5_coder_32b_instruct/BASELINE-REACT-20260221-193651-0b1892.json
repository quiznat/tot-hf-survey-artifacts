    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables. The equations are:\n1) 9x + 0y = 27\n2) -4x + 4y = -40\n\nI can see that the first equation has a coefficient of 0 for y, which means it's already solved for x. Let me solve this step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1: 9x = 27, so x = 3\nNow I can substitute x = 3 into equation 2 to find y.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the available tools. Since I have a system of two equations, I should use the solve2 tool which is designed for solving systems of linear equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[9, 0, 27], [-4, 4, -40]]",
