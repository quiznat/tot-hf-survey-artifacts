    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations of the form ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n1) 3x - 4y = 24  \n2) -6x + 0y = 0 \u2192 -6x = 0 \u2192 x = 0\n\nFrom equation 2, x = 0. Substituting into equation 1: 3(0) - 4y = 24 \u2192 -4y = 24 \u2192 y = -6.\n\nSo the solution is (x, y) = (0, -6). I can verify using check_xy or solve2. Since solve2 is likely designed for solving 2-variable linear systems, I'll use that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[3, -4, 24], [-6, 0, 0]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solve2 tool returned x = -0.000000 (essentially 0) and y = -6.000000, which matches my manual calculation. The solution (x, y) = (0, -6) satisfies both equations:  \n- Equation 1: 3(0) - 4(-6) = 24 \u2192 24 = 24 \u2713  \n- Equation 2: -6(0) + 0(-6) = 0 \u2192 0 = 0 \u2713  \n\nI can optionally verify with check_xy, but the solution is already confirmed. Since the task is solved, I should output the final answer.\n\nFINAL: (0, -6)"
