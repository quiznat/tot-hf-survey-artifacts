    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in two variables, represented as coefficients and constants. Each inner list [a, b, c] corresponds to an equation of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n\nEquation 1: 5x - 6y = -42  \nEquation 2: -4x + 6y = 36\n\nWe can solve this system using algebraic methods (e.g., elimination or substitution). Let's try elimination: adding the two equations eliminates y:\n\n(5x - 6y) + (-4x + 6y) = -42 + 36  \n\u2192 (5x - 4x) + (-6y + 6y) = -6  \n\u2192 x = -6\n\nNow substitute x = -6 into one of the equations to find y.

Now we need to compute y. Substituting x = -6 into Equation 1:  \n5(-6) - 6y = -42  \n\u2192 -30 - 6y = -42  \n\u2192 -6y = -12  \n\u2192 y = 2  \n\nSo the solution is (x, y) = (-6, 2). To verify, we can use the `check_xy` tool with x = -6, y = 2. Alternatively, since the system is small and we've solved it analytically, we could use `solve2`. But to be",
