    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input contains a list of linear equations in the form [a, b, c], representing the equation a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1. -4x + 8y = -56\n2. 9x + 9y = 45\n\nWe need to solve this system of two equations in two variables (x, y). We can use the `solve2` tool, which is designed for solving 2-variable linear systems. Let's pass the equations to `solve2`.\n\nThe input format for `solve2` likely expects the coefficients in a structured way \u2014 possibly as a list of equations, each with [a, b, c]. Since the input is already in that format, we can directly use it.\n\nLet\u2019s call `solve2` with the equations list.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-4, 8, -56], [9,",
