    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations given in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. The input equations are:  \n1) -9x - 9y = -99  \n2) 9x + 3y = 45  \n\nI can simplify equation 1 by dividing by -9: x + y = 11  \nEquation 2: 9x + 3y = 45 \u2192 divide by 3: 3x + y = 15  \n\nNow subtract simplified equation 1 from equation 2:  \n(3x + y) - (x + y) = 15 - 11 \u2192 2x = 4 \u2192 x = 2  \nThen from x + y = 11 \u2192 2 + y = 11 \u2192 y = 9  \n\nSo solution is x=2",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The manual solution gives x = 2, y = 9. To verify, I should use the check_xy tool with x=2 and y=9 to confirm both equations are satisfied. Alternatively, I can use solve2 to get the solution directly. Since solve2 is designed for solving 2-equation systems, it's more efficient to use that first.\nACTION: solve2 [[-9, -9, -99], [9, 3, 45]]",
