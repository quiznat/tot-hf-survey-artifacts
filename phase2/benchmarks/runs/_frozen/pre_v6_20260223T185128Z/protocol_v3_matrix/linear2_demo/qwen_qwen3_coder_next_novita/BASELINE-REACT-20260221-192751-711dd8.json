    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [a, b, c] representing equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\n- Equation 1: -5x + 6y = 33\n- Equation 2: -4x - 7y = 50\n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which is likely designed to solve a system of two linear equations. Let me try that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-5, 6, 33], [-4, -7, 50]]",

To verify correctness, I should use the `check_xy` tool to plug these values back into both original equations and confirm they hold true.\n\nACTION: check_xy -9 -2 [[-5, 6, 33], [-4, -7, 50]]\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: Both equations are satisfied:  \n- Equation 1: -5(-9) + 6(-2) = 45 - 12 = 33 \u2714\ufe0f  \n- Equation 2: -4(-9) - 7(-2) = 36 + 14 = 50 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTHINK: The verification confirms that x = -9 and y = -2 satisfy both equations exactly.
