    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in two variables, represented as coefficients and constants. Each inner list [a, b, c] corresponds to the equation a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 4x + 9y = -9  \nEquation 2: 9x - y = 86  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2x2 system directly). Since `solve2` is designed for solving 2-variable systems, it's the appropriate first tool to use.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[4, 9, -9], [9, -1, 86]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool successfully returned the solution x = 9.0 and y = -5.0 for the system of equations. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool by plugging x = 9 and y = -5 into both original equations.\n\nACTION: check_xy 9 -5",
