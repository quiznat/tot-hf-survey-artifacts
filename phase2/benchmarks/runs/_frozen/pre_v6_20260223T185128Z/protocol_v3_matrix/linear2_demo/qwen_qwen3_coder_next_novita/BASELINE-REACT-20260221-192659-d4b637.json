    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays. Each inner list likely represents an equation of the form ax + by = c. So:\n- Equation 1: -8x - y = 33\n- Equation 2: -8x -7y = -9\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since both equations have the same coefficient for x (-8), subtracting them may eliminate x. Let's compute manually first to guide tool usage.\n\nEquation 1: -8x - y = 33  \nEquation 2: -8x -7y = -9  \n\nSubtract Eq2 from Eq1:  \n(-8x - y) - (-8x -7y) = 33 - (-9)  \n\u2192 -8x - y + 8x + 7y = 42  \n\u2192 6y = 42 \u2192",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From the scratchpad, we have derived that 6y = 42, so y = 7. Now we can substitute y = 7 into one of the original equations to solve for x. Using Equation 1: -8x - y = 33 \u2192 -8x - 7 = 33 \u2192 -8x = 40 \u2192 x = -5. So the solution is (x, y) = (-5, 7). To verify, we can use the `check_xy` tool with x = -5, y = 7. Alternatively, we could use `solve2`, but since we already have the solution, verification is efficient. Let's verify with `check_xy`.\nACTION: check_xy -5 7",
