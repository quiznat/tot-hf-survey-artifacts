    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -9x + 7y = 15  \nEquation 2: -2x + 0y = 8 \u2192 -2x = 8 \u2192 x = -4\n\nWe can solve this system manually or use the available tools. Since solve2 is likely designed for solving 2-variable systems, and we have two equations, using solve2 seems appropriate. Let's try ACTION: solve2 with the equations.\n\nBut first, confirm format: equations are given as list of lists: [[-9,7,15],[-2,0,8]]. So tool input should be this structure.\n\nAlternatively, check_xy might verify a candidate solution, but we don\u2019t have a candidate yet. So better to use solve2.",
