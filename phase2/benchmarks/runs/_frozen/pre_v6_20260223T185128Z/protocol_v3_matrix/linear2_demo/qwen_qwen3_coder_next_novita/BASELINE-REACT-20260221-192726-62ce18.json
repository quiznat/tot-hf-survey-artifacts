    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n-5x - 7y = -16  \n-9x + 8y = -70  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system given the coefficient matrix and constants. Let me try that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-5, -7], [-9, 8]] [-16, -70]",

To verify correctness, I should use the `check_xy` tool to plug these values back into both original equations and confirm they hold true.\n\nACTION: check_xy 6 -2\nSTEP 1 OBSERVATION: Equation 1: -5(6) - 7(-2) = -30 + 14 = -16 \u2713  \nEquation 2: -9(6) + 8(-2) = -54 - 16 = -70 \u2713  \nBoth equations are satisfied.\n\nFINAL: x=6, y=-2"
