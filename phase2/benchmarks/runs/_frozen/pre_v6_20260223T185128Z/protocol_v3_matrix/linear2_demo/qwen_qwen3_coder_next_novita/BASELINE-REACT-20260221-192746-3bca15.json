    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -9x + 1y = -37\nEquation 2: 8x - 6y = -8\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can use solve2, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. Let's use solve2 with the equations.\n\nThe tool solve2 probably expects the coefficients in a structured way \u2014 maybe as two lists or a nested list. Since the input is already given as a list of two equations, each with [a, b, c], we can pass the entire list to solve2.\n\nLet\u2019s try ACTION: solve2 [[-9, 1, -37], [8, -6",

We can now provide the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=5, y=8"
