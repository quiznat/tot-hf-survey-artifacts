    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n- Equation 1: -2x + 4y = -22\n- Equation 2: 0x + 6y = -6 \u2192 6y = -6 \u2192 y = -1\n\nWe can solve this system. From equation 2, y = -1. Plug into equation 1:\n-2x + 4(-1) = -22 \u2192 -2x - 4 = -22 \u2192 -2x = -18 \u2192 x = 9.\n\nSo solution is x = 9, y = -1.\n\nWe can use `solve2` tool to verify or compute directly. Let's use `solve2` with the equations.\n\n`solve2` likely expects the equations as a list of lists, same as input",

I can verify this using `check_xy` with x=9, y=-1, or use `solve2` to compute directly. Since `solve2` is designed for solving 2-equation systems, I'll use that first.  \n\nACTION: solve2 [[-2, 4, -22], [0, 6, -6]]",
