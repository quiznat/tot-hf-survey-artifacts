    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) 5x - 5y = 65  \n2) 6x - 2y = 42  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve this system. Let's try to simplify and solve manually first, or use the available tools.\n\nLet\u2019s simplify equation 1: divide by 5 \u2192 x - y = 13 \u2192 x = y + 13  \nSubstitute into equation 2:  \n6(y + 13) - 2y = 42  \n6y + 78 - 2y = 42  \n4y + 78 = 42  \n4y = 42 -",
