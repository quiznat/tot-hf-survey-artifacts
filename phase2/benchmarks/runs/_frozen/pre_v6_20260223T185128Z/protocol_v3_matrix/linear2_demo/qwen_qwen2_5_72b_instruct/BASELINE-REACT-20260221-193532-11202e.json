    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The input is a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. Each list within 'equations' represents an equation where the last element is the constant term and the preceding elements are the coefficients of the variables. Here, we have two equations with three variables, which suggests that this might be an underdetermined system or there might be some other relationship that can be exploited. Given the tools available, `solve2` seems to be the appropriate tool for solving systems of linear equations, so I will use it next.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-5, 0, 25] [1, 2, -11]",
