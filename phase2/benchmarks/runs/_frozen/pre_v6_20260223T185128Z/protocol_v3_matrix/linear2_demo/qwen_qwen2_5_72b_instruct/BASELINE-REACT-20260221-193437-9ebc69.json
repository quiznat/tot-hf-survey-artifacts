    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to solve the system of linear equations represented in matrix form, where each row is an equation and the last number in each row is the constant term. The equations can be written as:\n1) -2x + 4y = -22\n2) 0x + 6y = -6\n\nThe second equation simplifies directly to y = -1. With this value of y, we can substitute it into the first equation to find x. However, since we have a tool `solve2` that can solve a system of linear equations, let's use it directly with the provided inputs.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-2, 4, -22, 0, 6, -6]",
