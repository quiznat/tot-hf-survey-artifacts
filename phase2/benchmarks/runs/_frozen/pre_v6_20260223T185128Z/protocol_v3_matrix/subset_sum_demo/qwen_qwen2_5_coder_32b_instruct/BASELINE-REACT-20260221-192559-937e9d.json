    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a way to combine the given numbers [2, 2, 6, 11, 14] to reach the target value 17. Let me think about different combinations and use the available tools to check my work.\n\nFirst, let me try some simple combinations:\n- 2 + 2 = 4\n- 6 + 11 = 17\n\nThat's interesting! If I use 6 and 11, they sum to 17. But I still have 2, 2, and 14 left over. Let me see if I can make the remaining numbers equal zero or find another approach.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The goal is to use some subset of these numbers that sum to 17. \nLet me try: 6 + 11 = 17. This uses two numbers and reaches exactly the target.\nSo",

This uses two numbers from the list and reaches the target perfectly. \n\nLet me verify this is correct by using the sum_list tool to confirm 6 + 11 = 17, and then use check_target to validate that this combination meets the requirements.\n\nACTION: sum_list [6, 11]",
