Let me analyze the available tools and approach this systematically.\n\nI have:\n- Numbers: [4, 5, 11, 15, 19]\n- Target: 50\n\nThe available tools are:\n1. check_target - likely verifies if a sum equals the target\n2. sum_list - likely sums a list of numbers\n\nSince I'm looking for a combination that sums to 50, I should try different combinations systematically. Let me start by checking if any single number equals 50 (it doesn't), then check pairs, then triplets, etc.\n\nLet me first try summing all numbers to see what we get.\nACTION: sum_list [4, 5, 11, 15, 19]",
