    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to determine if there is a subset of the given numbers that sums up to the target value. I can start by checking if the sum of the entire list is equal to or greater than the target. If it's less, then it's impossible to reach the target. If it's equal or greater, I will use the check_target tool to see if a subset exists that meets the target.\n\nACTION: sum_list {'numbers': [7, 14, 15, 17, 18, 18, 20]}",
