However, since 25 is close to 27, I will try adjusting the combination by including the next smallest number that hasn't been included yet, which is 15, but I will need to exclude one of the current numbers to avoid exceeding the target. Given the current sum of 25, I only need 2 more to reach 27, so I will replace 6 with 15 - 12 = 3, but since 3 is not available, I will try replacing 6 with 15 directly and see if it matches the target.\nACTION: sum",
