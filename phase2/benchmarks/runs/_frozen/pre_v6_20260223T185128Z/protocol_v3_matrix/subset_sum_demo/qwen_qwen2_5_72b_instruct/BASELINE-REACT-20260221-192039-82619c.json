    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this task, I need to find if any combination of the given numbers can sum up to the target number. The 'sum_list' tool can be used to get the sum of elements in a list, and 'check_target' can be used to verify if the target is met. However, to use these effectively, I first need to generate possible combinations of the numbers. Since I don't have a direct way to generate combinations with the available tools, I will start by checking if the sum of all numbers equals the target as a first step.\n\nACTION: sum_list [1, 2, 4, 10, 18]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of all the numbers in the list is 35, which is greater than the target of 22. This means not all numbers are needed to reach the target. I should now try to systematically exclude numbers from the list to see if I can match the target. Starting with the largest number might be a good strategy since it's more likely to help achieve the target quickly.\n\nACTION: sum_list [1, 2, 4, 10]",

The next logical step would be to include the next largest number that was excluded, which is 18. However, adding 18 to 17 will exceed the target (17 + 18 = 35). Instead, we should consider including smaller numbers to reach the target.\n\nACTION: sum_list [1, 2, 4, 18]\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: 25\nSTEP 4 MODEL: THINK: The sum of [1, 2, 4, 18] is 25, which is also greater than the target of 22.
