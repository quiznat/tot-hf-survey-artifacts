    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the given numbers [6, 7, 15, 15, 17, 17, 19] that sums to the target 43.

Let me first try to reason about possible combinations.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the numbers: 6, 7, 15, 15, 17, 17, 19.\n\nTotal sum = 6+7+15+15+17+17+19 = let's compute: 6+7=13, +15=28, +15=43, +17=60, +17=77, +1",

However, note that the partial sum up to the second 15 is already 43: 6 + 7 + 15 + 15 = 43. Let me verify this candidate subset using sum_list.",
