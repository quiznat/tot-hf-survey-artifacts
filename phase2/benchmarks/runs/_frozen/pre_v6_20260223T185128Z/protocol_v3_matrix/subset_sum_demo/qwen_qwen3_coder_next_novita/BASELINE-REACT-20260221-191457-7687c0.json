    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the given numbers [1, 7, 11, 13, 13, 14, 20] that sums to the target 53. I need to use the available tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a list sums to the target. Let me first try to reason about possible combinations.\n\nTotal sum of all numbers: 1 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 13 + 14 + 20 = 79. So we need to exclude numbers summing to 79 - 53 = 26.\n\nAlternatively, try to build up to 53.\n\nLet\u2019s try including the largest number, 20. Then need 33 more.\n\nRemaining: [1, 7, 11",
