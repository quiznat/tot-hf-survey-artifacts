    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the numbers [4, 5, 15, 17, 20] that sums to the target 41.

That works!  \nI should verify using the sum_list tool to confirm.  \nAlternatively, I could use check_target directly with a candidate subset. Since I have a candidate [20, 17, 4], I'll use sum_list to compute its sum first to be safe.  \nBut the tools available are check_target and sum_list.
