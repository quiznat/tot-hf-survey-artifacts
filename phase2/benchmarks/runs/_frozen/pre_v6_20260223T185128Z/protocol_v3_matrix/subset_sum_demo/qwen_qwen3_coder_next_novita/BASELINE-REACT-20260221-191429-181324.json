    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the numbers [1, 2, 8, 16, 17, 20] that sums to the target 36. I need to use the available tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a list sums to the target. Let me start by trying some combinations. First, I'll try the full list sum to see how close it is.  \nACTION: sum_list [1, 2, 8, 16, 17, 20]",

Since 20 + 16 = 36, that\u2019s already the target! Let me verify using `check_target` on [20, 16].  \nACTION: check_target [20, 16]",
