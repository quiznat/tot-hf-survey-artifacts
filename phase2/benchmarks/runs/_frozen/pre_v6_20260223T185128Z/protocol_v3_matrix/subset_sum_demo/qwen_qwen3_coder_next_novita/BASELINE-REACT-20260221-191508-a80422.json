    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the numbers [1, 2, 4, 10, 18] that sums to the target 22. I can use the `sum_list` tool to compute sums of subsets, and `check_target` to verify if a sum equals the target. Let me start by trying combinations. First, try the full list: 1 + 2 + 4 + 10 + 18 = 35, which is too high. Try excluding 1: 2 + 4 + 10 + 18 = 34. Excluding 2: 1 + 4 + 10 + 18 = 33. Excluding 4: 1 + 2 + 10 + 18 = 31.

From STEP 1, I was computing sums of 4-element subsets, but none matched yet. Let me try specific promising subsets. Note that 18 + 4 = 22 \u2014 that\u2019s exactly the target! So the subset [4, 18] should work. Let me verify using `sum_list`.",
