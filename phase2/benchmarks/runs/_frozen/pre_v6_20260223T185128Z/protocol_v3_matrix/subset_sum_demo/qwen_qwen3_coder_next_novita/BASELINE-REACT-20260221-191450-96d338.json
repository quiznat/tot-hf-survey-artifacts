Since `sum_list` likely computes the sum of a list, and `check_target` likely checks if a value equals the target, I should first try summing all numbers to see if it equals 42. Let's compute the sum: 1 + 1 + 7 + 10 + 16 + 16 = 51. That's not 42. So I need to find a subset or combination that sums to 42.

Looking at the numbers [1, 1, 7, 10, 16, 16], can I find a subset that sums to 9? Yes: 1 + 1 + 7 = 9. So if I exclude those three numbers (1, 1, 7), the remaining numbers are [10, 16, 16], and their sum is 10 + 16 + 16 = 42. Let me verify using `sum_list` on [10, 16, 16].",
