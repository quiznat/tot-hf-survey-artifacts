    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 53 using the list of numbers [4, 13, 14, 15, 20]. I have two tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a given list sums to the target. First, I should try summing the entire list to see if it equals 53. If not, I may need to try subsets or combinations.\n\nLet me compute the sum of the full list: 4 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 20 = 66, which is greater than 53. So the full list doesn\u2019t work. I need to find a subset that sums to 53.\n\nLet me try some subsets. For example, try [13, 14, 15, 20] =",

Try [13, 14, 20] = 47 \u2014 too low. Try [13, 15, 20] = 48 \u2014 too low. Try [14, 15, 20] = 49 \u2014 same. Try adding 4 to [14, 15, 20] = 4",

Looking at the list: [4, 13, 14, 15, 20]. The number 13 is present \u2014 removing just 13 gives sum = 66 \u2212 13 = 53. So the subset [4, 14, 15, 20] should sum to 53.
