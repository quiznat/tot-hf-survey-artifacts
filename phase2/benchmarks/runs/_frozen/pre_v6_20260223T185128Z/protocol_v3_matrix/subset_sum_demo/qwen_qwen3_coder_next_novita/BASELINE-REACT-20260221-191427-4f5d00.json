    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target value of 20 using the numbers [2, 2, 7, 8, 10] with available tools: `sum_list` (to compute sum of a list) and `check_target` (to verify if a list sums to the target).

Wait, no: the input list is [2, 2, 7, 8, 10], so there are *two* 2s. So [2, 8, 10] uses only one 2, which should be allowed. But the tool flagged it as invalid \u2014 perhaps the tool expects *all* numbers to be used? Or maybe the tool expects the list to be used exactly as given (i.e., order or multiplicity matters)?
