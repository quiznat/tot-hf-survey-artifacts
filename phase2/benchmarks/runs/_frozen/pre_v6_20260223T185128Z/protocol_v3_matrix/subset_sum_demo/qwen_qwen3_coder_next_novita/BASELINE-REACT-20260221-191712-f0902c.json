    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 48 using the given list of numbers [2, 9, 10, 16, 17, 20] and available tools: `sum_list` and `check_target`. Since `sum_list` likely sums a subset of numbers, and `check_target` likely checks if a given list sums to the target, I need to find a subset of the numbers that sums to 48.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the total sum of all numbers: 2 + 9 + 10 + 16 + 17 + 20 = 74. So 48 is less than the total, meaning a subset is possible.\n\nTry to find a subset summing to 48.\n\nLet\u2019s try large numbers first: 20 + 17 + 10 = 47 \u2192 need 1 more, but",
