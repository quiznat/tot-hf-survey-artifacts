    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target value of 22 using the numbers [4, 4, 7, 7, 17] with available tools: `sum_list` (to compute sum of a list) and `check_target` (to verify if a list reaches the target). Since we have only two tools, and `sum_list` just computes the sum, likely the goal is to find a subset or combination (e.g., using arithmetic operations) \u2014 but the tools don\u2019t include arithmetic ops like add/subtract/multiply/divide. So perhaps the intended use is to try candidate lists (e.g., subsets) and use `check_target` to verify if they meet the target.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the tools are limited: only `check_target` and `sum_list`.

Available tools are `sum_list` (returns sum of a list) and `check_target` (likely checks if a given list's sum equals the target). Since no arithmetic operations are directly available, the intended approach is likely to construct candidate subsets or combinations (e.g., subsets of the input numbers) and test them with `check_target`. Let\u2019s first try the full list: sum = 4+4+7+7+17 = 39 \u2260 22. Try subsets. Try [17, 4, 4] = 25, too big. Try [17, 4] = 21, close. Try [17, 7] = 24. Try [7, 7, 4",

Since only `sum_list` and `check_target` are available, and no arithmetic operations are directly provided, the most plausible interpretation is that `check_target` takes a list and returns whether its sum equals the target (22).
