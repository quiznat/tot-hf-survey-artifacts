    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9965. Let's verify and reason.\n\nA number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Since we don\u2019t have 0, the only possible last digit is 5.\n\nSo the number must end in 5. The remaining digits are [6, 9, 9] to arrange in the first three positions. To maximize the number, we want the largest digits first: 9, 9, 6 \u2192 9965.\n\nCheck: 9965 ends in 5 \u2192 divisible by 5. Is it divisible? Let's verify using is_divisible.\n\nBut we can also compute: 9",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The reasoning so far is correct: for divisibility by 5, the last digit must be 0 or 5. Since 0 is not in the digit set, only 5 can be the last digit. Remaining digits [6, 9, 9] should be arranged in descending order to maximize the number: 9965. The oracle says 9965 is the maximum, which matches our construction. Now we should verify that 9965 is indeed divisible by 5 using the is_divisible tool.",
