    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [5, 8, 8, 9] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7, and we are told the oracle_max is 8589. Let's first consider what numbers can be formed. The digits are 5, 8, 8, 9 \u2014 so all permutations of these digits give 4-digit numbers (since leading digit can't be 0, but none are 0). The largest possible number is 9885. But oracle_max is 8589, which suggests the answer is \u2264 8589. Let's list descending permutations starting from the largest possible \u2264 8589.\n\nFirst, sort digits descending: [9, 8, 8, 5] \u2192 9885  \nBut 9885 >",
