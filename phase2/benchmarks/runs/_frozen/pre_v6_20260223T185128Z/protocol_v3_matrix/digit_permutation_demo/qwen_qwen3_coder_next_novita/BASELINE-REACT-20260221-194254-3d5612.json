    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by permuting the digits [2, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum is 6525. Let's verify if 6525 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 6525 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, 6525 uses digits 6, 5, 2, 5 \u2014 which matches the available digits [2, 5, 6, 5]. Since the oracle says 6525 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 6525. But to follow the ReAct loop, I should confirm using the tools if needed. Let's use is_div",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle claims the maximum divisible number is 6525. To verify, I need to check two things: (1) 6525 uses exactly the digits [2,5,6,5], and (2) it is divisible by 5. The digits of 6525 are 6,5,2,5 \u2014 matching the multiset [2,5,6,5]. For divisibility by 5, a number must end in 0 or 5; 6525 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Since the oracle's answer is consistent with the constraints, and no contradictory evidence exists, I can accept 6525 as the answer. However, to strictly follow the ReAct protocol, I should confirm using the provided tools before concluding.\nACTION: is_divisible 6525 5",
