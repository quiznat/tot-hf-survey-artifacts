    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [5, 3, 8, 8] that is divisible by 6, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 8538. Let\u2019s recall: a number is divisible by 6 iff it\u2019s divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2 \u21d2 last digit must be even \u21d2 possible last digits: 8, 8 (only even digits available are 8s).  \n- Divisible by 3 \u21d2 sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24, which is divisible by 3 \u21d2 any permutation of these digits is divisible by 3. So we just need the largest permutation ending in 8.  \nThe largest permutation of [5,3,8,8] is 885",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The largest permutation of [5, 3, 8, 8] is 8853, but 3 is odd, so 8853 is not divisible by 2. We need the largest permutation ending in 8 (the only even digit available). Let's list candidates in descending order ending in 8:  \n- Try 8858? Wait, digits are [5,3,8,8] \u2014 only two 8s, so last digit 8 uses one 8, remaining digits [5,3,8] to arrange in front.  \nLargest arrangement of remaining digits: 8,5,3 \u2192 8538. That matches oracle_max = 8538.  \nCheck: 8538 ends in 8 (even), sum = 8+5+3+8 = 24 (divisible by",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The reasoning so far is solid: sum of digits is 24 (divisible by 3), so divisibility by 6 reduces to evenness. Only even digits are 8s, so last digit must be 8. With one 8 fixed at the end, remaining digits [5,3,8] arranged in descending order give 8538, which matches the oracle_max. To confirm correctness, we should verify that 8538 is divisible by 6 using the is_divisible tool. Alternatively, best_divisible might directly return the answer, but since we suspect 8538 is the answer and it's provided as oracle_max, verifying divisibility is prudent. Let's use is_divisible with 8538 and divisor 6.",
