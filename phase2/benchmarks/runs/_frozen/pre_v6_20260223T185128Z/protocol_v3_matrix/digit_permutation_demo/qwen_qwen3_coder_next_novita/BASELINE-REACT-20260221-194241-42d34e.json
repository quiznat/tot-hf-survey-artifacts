    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 9, 8, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is 9888, which is the largest permutation of those digits. We need to check divisibility by 6 \u2014 a number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nDivisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 8 (since digits are 8,9,8,8 \u2014 only 8 is even). So any valid number must end in 8.\n\nDivisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 8+9+8+8 = 33, which is divisible by 3. So *any* permutation of these digits is divisible by 3.",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since all permutations of the digits [8,9,8,8] have digit sum 33 (divisible by 3), and only numbers ending in 8 are even (hence divisible by 2), we only need to consider permutations ending in 8. The largest such number would be formed by placing the largest remaining digits in descending order before the final 8. The digits excluding one 8 are [9,8,8], so the largest arrangement is 9888 \u2014 which ends in 8 and uses all digits. Since 9888 is the oracle_max and ends in 8, and sum is divisible by 3, it must be divisible by 6. Let's verify with is_divisible to be safe.\nACTION: is_divisible 9888",
