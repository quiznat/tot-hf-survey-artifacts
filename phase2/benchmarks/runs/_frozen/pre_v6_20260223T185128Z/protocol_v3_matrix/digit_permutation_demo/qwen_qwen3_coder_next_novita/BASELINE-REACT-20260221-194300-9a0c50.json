    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [7, 2, 4, 5] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 7542, which is likely the largest permutation (7542), but we need to verify if it's divisible by 6. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation that is divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits from [7,2,4,5] are 2 or 4.\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 7+2+4+5 = 18, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 all",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 7+2+4+5 = 18, which is divisible by 3, so any permutation will satisfy divisibility by 3. For divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even \u2192 only 2 or 4 are valid endings. The largest permutation is 7542 (ends with 2, even), so we should check if 7542 is divisible by 6. Since it's divisible by both 2 and 3, it should be divisible by 6. Let's verify using the is_divisible tool.",
