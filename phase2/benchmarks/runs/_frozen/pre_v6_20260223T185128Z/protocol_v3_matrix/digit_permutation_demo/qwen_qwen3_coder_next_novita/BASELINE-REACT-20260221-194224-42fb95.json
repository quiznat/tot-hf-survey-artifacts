    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6312. Let's verify if 6312 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 6312, last two digits are 12, and 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 divisible. So 6312 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says 6312 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 6312. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools: first check if 6312 is divisible by 4 using is_divisible, and if so,",
