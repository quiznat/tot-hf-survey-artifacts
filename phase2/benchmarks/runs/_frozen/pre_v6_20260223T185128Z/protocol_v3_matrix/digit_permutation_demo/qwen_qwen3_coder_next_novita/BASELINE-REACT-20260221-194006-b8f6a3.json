    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 9, 8, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is 9888, which is the largest possible number with those digits. We need to check divisibility by 6, which requires divisibility by both 2 and 3.\n\nDivisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 8 (since digits are 8,9,8,8 \u2014 only 8 is even).\n\nDivisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 8+9+8+8 = 33, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 any permutation is divisible by 3.\n\nSo we only need to ensure the number ends in 8 (to be divisible by 2), and since",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since the sum of digits is 33 (divisible by 3), all permutations are divisible by 3. For divisibility by 6, we also need divisibility by 2, which requires the number to end in an even digit \u2014 only 8 is even in the multiset [8,9,8,8]. So we need the largest permutation ending in 8. The largest arrangement would place the largest remaining digits first: sort remaining digits [9,8,8] in descending order \u2192 988, then append 8 \u2192 9888. Since 9888 ends in 8 and sum is 33, it's divisible by 6. The oracle_max is 9888, so likely 9888 is the answer. Let's verify with is_divisible to be safe.",
