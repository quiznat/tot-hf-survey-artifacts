    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 3, 2, 1] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max is given as 4312, which suggests that 4312 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and divisible by 11). Let's verify:  \n- Permutations of [4,3,2,1] in descending order: 4321, 4312, 4231, etc.  \n- Check divisibility by 11: A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is a multiple of 11 (including 0).
