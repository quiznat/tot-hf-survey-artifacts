    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and we are told the oracle_max is 9444. Since 9444 is the maximum possible number with those digits (digits sorted descending: 9, 4, 4, 4), we should first check if 9444 is divisible by 6. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation that is divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 last digit must be 4 (only even digit available).\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3 \u2192 sum = 4+4+",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 4 + 4 + 9 + 4 = 21, which is divisible by 3. So any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3. For divisibility by 6, we also need divisibility by 2, i.e., the number must end in an even digit. The only even digit available is 4, so the number must end in 4. The largest possible number ending in 4 using digits [4, 4, 9, 4] is formed by placing the largest remaining digits in descending order before the final 4. Remaining digits after fixing last digit as 4: [4, 4, 9] \u2192 sorted descending: 9, 4, 4 \u2192 so candidate is 9444. Since 9444 ends in 4 (even) and sum = 21 divisible by",

Only even digit is 4, so number must end in 4. The largest arrangement ending in 4 is 9444 (digits before last: 9, 4, 4 in descending order). Since 9444 ends in 4 and sum is divisible by 3, it is divisible by 6. We should verify using the is_divisible tool to be sure.",
