    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 3, 7, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9732. Let's verify if 9732 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9732, the last two digits are 32, and 32 \u00f7 4 = 8, so 32 is divisible by 4. Therefore, 9732 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says 9732 is the maximum, and it's divisible by 4, the answer should be 9732. Let's confirm using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 9732 4",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: yes"
