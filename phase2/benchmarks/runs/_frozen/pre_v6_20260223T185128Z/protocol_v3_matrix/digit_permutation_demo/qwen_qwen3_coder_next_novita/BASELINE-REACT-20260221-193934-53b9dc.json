    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 2] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9420. Let's verify if 9420 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2: last digit is 0 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits = 9+4+0+2 = 15, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 9420 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9420. But to be thorough, maybe I should confirm using the tools. Let",

Since it's the maximum and valid, no further checks are needed.
