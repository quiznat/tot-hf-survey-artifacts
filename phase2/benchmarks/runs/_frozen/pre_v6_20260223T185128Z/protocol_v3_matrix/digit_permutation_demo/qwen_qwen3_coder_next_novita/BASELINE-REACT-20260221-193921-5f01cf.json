    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 8, 4, 6] that is divisible by 3, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 8664. Let's verify if 8664 is divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Digits of 8664: 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 24, and 24 is divisible by 3, so 8664 is divisible by 3. Also, 8664 uses the digits [6, 8, 6, 4] \u2014 which matches the multiset of available digits [6, 8, 4, 6]. So 8664 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says the maximum",
