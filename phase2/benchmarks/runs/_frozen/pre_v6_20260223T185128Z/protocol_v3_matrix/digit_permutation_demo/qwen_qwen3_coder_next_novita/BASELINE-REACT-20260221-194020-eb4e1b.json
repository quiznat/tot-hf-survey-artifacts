    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is given as 4312, which suggests that 4312 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum permutation divisible by 8). But I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, I should check if 4312 is divisible by 8 using the `is_divisible` tool. If yes, and it's the maximum permutation (which it likely is, since digits sorted descending give 4321, and 4312 is close), then that's the answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, I could use `best_divisible` directly, which likely returns the maximum divisible permutation.\n\nLet me try `best_divisible` first, as it's designed for this task.\n\nACTION",

If it is, and since 4312 is a high permutation (descending order would be 4321, and 4312 is just slightly less), it's likely the correct answer.
