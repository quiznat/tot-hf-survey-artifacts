    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [3, 5, 6, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 5536. Let\u2019s verify if 5536 is achievable with the given digits: digits of 5536 are [5, 5, 3, 6] \u2014 matches the multiset [3,5,6,5]. So 5536 is a candidate. Now check if 5536 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. Last three digits of 5536 are 536. Is 536 divisible by 8? 536 \u00f7 8 = 67, exactly. So",
