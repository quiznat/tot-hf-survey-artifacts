    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 2, 4, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 2443, which suggests that the maximum possible number formed by these digits is 4432, but 2443 might be the largest valid divisible number or an upper bound. Let's first compute the maximum possible number: digits sorted descending = [4, 4, 3, 2] \u2192 4432. We need to find the largest permutation \u2264 4432 (or exactly using the digits) divisible by 7.\n\nWe have two tools: `is_divisible(n, divisor)` and `best_divisible(digits, divisor)`. Since `best_divisible` likely solves the problem directly, and the task is to solve the benchmark,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number formed by permuting digits [3, 2, 4, 4] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is 2443, which is suspiciously *less* than the maximum possible number (4432), suggesting 2443 may be the correct answer or an upper bound on the solution. However, 2443 uses digits [2, 4, 4, 3] \u2014 exactly our digits \u2014 so it's a valid candidate. Let's verify if 2443 is divisible by 7 using `is_divisible`. If yes, and it's the largest such number (we can check descending permutations), but since `best_divisible` is available and likely optimized, we should use it directly.\nACTION: best_divisible [3, 2, 4, 4] 7",
