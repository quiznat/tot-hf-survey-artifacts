    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 4319, which is likely the correct answer (since 4319 \u00f7 7 = 617, and 7\u00d7617=4319). But I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, I can check if 4319 is divisible by 7 using `is_divisible`.\n\nIf yes, and it's the maximum possible permutation (since digits sorted descending is 9,4,3,1 \u2192 9431, but 4319 is less than that \u2014 wait, 4319 is not the max permutation; max is 9431), so",
