    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [7, 5, 3, 5] that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max constraint tells me the answer should not exceed 7535.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 7, 5, 3, 5. I can arrange them in different orders to create different 4-digit numbers.\n\nTo check divisibility by 11, I'll use the rule: a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of digits in odd positions and the sum of digits in even positions is divisible by 11 (including 0).\n\nLet me try to find the largest possible number first, then check if it's divisible by 11, and work my way down if needed.\n\nThe largest arrangement would be 755",

First, I'll identify all possible 4-digit arrangements of digits [7, 5, 3, 5]\n2. Check which ones are divisible by 11\n3. Among those, select the largest one that doesn't exceed 7535\n\nSince I want the largest number, I should start with arrangements that begin with the highest digit (7) and work my way down.\n\nThe largest possible arrangement without any constraints would be 7553.\nHowever, I also need to consider that 7553 might not be divisible by 11.\n\nLet me check divisibility by 11 using the alternating",
