    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 8, 5] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max of 5803 suggests there's an upper limit, but I should first determine what the largest possible number is with these digits, then check divisibility.\n\nLet me think about this systematically:\n1. First, I should arrange the digits in descending order to get the largest possible number: 8530\n2. Then I need to check if this number is divisible by 7\n3. If not, I'll need to try other arrangements that are less than or equal to 8530 and see which ones are divisible by 7\n\nActually, let me approach this more carefully. Since I want the largest number divisible by 7, I should:\n1. Try different arrangements of the digits\n2. Check each for divis",

I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 8, 5] that is divisible by 7, with the constraint that it cannot exceed 5803.\n\nFirst, let me identify what numbers I can form with these digits:\n- The digits are: 3, 0, 8, 5\n- To make the largest number, I should arrange them in descending order: 8530\n- But I also have the constraint that the result must be \u2264 5803\n\nSince 8530 > 5803, I cannot use 8530.
