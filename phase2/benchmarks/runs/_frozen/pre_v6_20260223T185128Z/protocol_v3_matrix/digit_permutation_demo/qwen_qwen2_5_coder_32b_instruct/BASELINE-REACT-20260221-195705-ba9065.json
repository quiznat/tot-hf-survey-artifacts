    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 6, 0] that is divisible by 6. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 6:\n- A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it's divisible by both 2 and 3\n- For divisibility by 2: the last digit must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)\n- For divisibility by 3: the sum of all digits must be divisible by 3\n\nLet me check the sum of the available digits: 3 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 9\nSince 9 is divisible by 3, any arrangement of these digits will satisfy the divisibility by 3 condition.\n\nFor divisibility by 2, I need the last",

The largest digit is 6, followed by 3, then 0, then 0.\n\nIf I put 6 at the end (making it divisible by 2), the remaining digits [3, 0, 0] arranged in descending order would be 300.
