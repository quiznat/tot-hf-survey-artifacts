    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [1, 2, 5, 4] that is divisible by 3. The oracle_max of 5421 gives me an upper bound to consider.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 3: a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\nLet me check the sum of available digits: 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 12. Since 12 is divisible by 3, any arrangement of these digits will form a number divisible by 3.\n\nTo get the largest possible number under 5421, I should arrange the digits in descending order (5, 4, 2, 1) to form 5421. But I need to check if this is actually valid and within bounds.\n\nActually,",
