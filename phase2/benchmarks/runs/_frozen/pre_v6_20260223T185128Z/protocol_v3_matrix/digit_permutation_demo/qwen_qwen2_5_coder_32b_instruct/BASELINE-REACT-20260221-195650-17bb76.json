    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 4, 2, 1] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max of 4102 suggests this is a constraint on the maximum value I should consider.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 0, 4, 2, 1. I can arrange them in different orders to create different numbers.\n\nSince I want the largest possible number that's divisible by 7, I should try to form the largest possible numbers first and check if they're divisible by 7.\n\nThe largest arrangement would be 4210, but I should also consider other arrangements like 4201, 4120, etc.\n\nLet me start by trying to form the largest possible numbers and check divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\":",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The tool response shows 4102, which is the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 4, 2, 1] that is divisible by 7. However, I need to verify this is correct by checking if 4102 is actually divisible by 7 and if it's indeed the largest such number.\n\nLet me double-check by manually verifying:\n- 4102 \u00f7 7 = 586 (exact division)\n- This means 4102 is divisible by 7\n\nAlso, I should confirm that 4102 is indeed the largest number possible with these digits that's divisible by 7. The arrangement 4102 uses all digits exactly once and gives us the maximum possible value.\n\nFINAL: 4102"
