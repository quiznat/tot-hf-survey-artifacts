    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 2, 3, 1] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 8312. \n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me think about this systematically:\n1. I have digits [8, 2, 3, 1]\n2. I want the largest possible number \u2264 8312 that's divisible by 8\n3. To maximize the number, I should try to arrange the digits in descending order as much as possible\n4. But I also need to ensure the resulting number is divisible by 8\n\nLet me first check what numbers I can make and test their divisibility by 8.",
