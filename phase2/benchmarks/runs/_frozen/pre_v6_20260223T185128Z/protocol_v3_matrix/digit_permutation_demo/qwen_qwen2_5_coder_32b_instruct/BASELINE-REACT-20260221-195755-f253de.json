    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 8, 1, 6] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max of 5816 suggests there's an upper bound, but I should first determine what the largest possible number is using these digits, then check divisibility.\n\nLet me think about this systematically:\n1. To get the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order: 8651\n2. However, I need to ensure this number is divisible by 8\n3. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8\n4. I should try different arrangements and check divisibility\n\nLet me start by checking if 8651 is divisible by 8, and if not, work with other arrangements.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 8651 8\n\nWait",
