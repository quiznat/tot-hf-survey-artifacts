    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 6312.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me identify all possible 4-digit combinations from [3, 1, 6, 2] and check which ones are divisible by 4, keeping in mind the oracle_max constraint.\n\nThe largest possible number would be 6321, but I need to check if it's divisible by 4.\nActually, let me approach this systematically by finding the largest valid number.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 1, 6, 2], \"divisor\":",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I've received the result from best_divisible tool. It returned 6312, which means 6312 is the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4 and does not exceed the oracle_max of 6312.\n\nLet me verify this is correct:\n- The digits used are 6, 3, 1, 2 (all from the given set [3, 1, 6, 2])\n- 6312 \u00f7 4 = 1578, so it is divisible by 4\n- It's the largest possible number under 6312 using these digits\n\nFINAL: 6312"
