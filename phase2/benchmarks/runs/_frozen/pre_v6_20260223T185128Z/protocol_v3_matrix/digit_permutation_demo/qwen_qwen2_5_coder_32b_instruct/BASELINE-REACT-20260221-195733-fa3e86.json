Let me verify this is correct by checking if 4312 is indeed divisible by 11 and that it's formed using the digits [4, 3, 2, 1].\n\nTo check divisibility by 11, I can use the alternating sum rule: subtract and add digits alternately from left to right.\nFor 4312: 4 - 3 + 1 - 2 = 0\n\nSince 0 is divisible by 11, 4312 is divisible by 11.\n\nAlso, 4312 uses exactly the digits 4, 3, 2, 1 once each.\n\nLet me double-check by trying other arrangements to make sure 4312 is indeed the largest possible.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 4312, \"",
