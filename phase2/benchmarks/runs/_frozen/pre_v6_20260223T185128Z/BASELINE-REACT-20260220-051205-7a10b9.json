    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [4, 4, 4, 9], and the only available tool is `calc`. This resembles the classic \"24 game\" where the goal is to combine numbers using arithmetic operations to reach 24. Let me check if that's the case here.\n\nWe have four numbers: 4, 4, 4, 9. Try combinations:\n\n- 9 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21 \u2192 too low  \n- 9 \u00d7 4 - 4 - 4 = 36 - 8 = 28  \n- 9 \u00d7 (4 + 4/4) = 9 \u00d7 (4 + 1) = 9 \u00d7 5 = 45  \n- (9 - 4) \u00d7 4 + 4 = 5 \u00d7 4",

Only `calc`, which likely supports +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses.  \nTry: (4 + 4) \u00d7 (9 \u00f7 4) = 8 \u00d7 2.25 = 18 \u2014 no.  \nHow about: 9 \u00d7 (4 + 4) \u00f7 4 = 9 \u00d7 8 \u00f7 4 = 72 \u00f7 4 = 18 \u2014 still no.  \nTry: (9 \u00d7 4) - (4 + 4) = 36 - 8 =",
