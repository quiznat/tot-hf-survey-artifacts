    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 4, 8, 10]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer what might be expected. Common benchmark tasks with number sequences include finding the next number, summing the numbers, computing an average, or identifying a pattern. Let\u2019s analyze the sequence:\n\n2, 4, 8, 10  \nDifferences: +2, +4, +2 \u2014 not constant.  \nRatios: 4/2 = 2, 8/4 = 2, 10/8 = 1.25 \u2014 not geometric.  \nCould be alternating pattern: +2, +4, then +2 again? Next might be +4 \u2192 14? Or maybe it's numbers that are even but not divisible by 3? All are even. Or maybe numbers with exactly two 1-b",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sequence [2, 4, 8, 10] shows differences of +2, +4, +2. This suggests a possible alternating pattern of +2, +4. If so, the next difference would be +4, giving 10 + 4 = 14. Alternatively, maybe it's numbers that are even but not multiples of 3 \u2014 all numbers satisfy that, and next would be 14 (since 12 is divisible by 3). Another angle: binary representations: 2=10, 4=100, 8=1000, 10=1010 \u2014 not obvious. Since the task is ambiguous and no explicit instruction is given, but benchmark tasks often ask for the next number in the sequence, and +2, +4, +2, +4 is a plausible pattern, 14 is a strong",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The sequence [2, 4, 8, 10] has differences: +2, +4, +2. This suggests an alternating pattern of +2, +4. Following this, the next difference should be +4, yielding 10 + 4 = 14. Alternatively, considering numbers that are even but not divisible by 3: 2, 4, 8, 10, then 14 (skipping 12 which is divisible by 3). Both patterns support 14 as the next term. Since benchmark tasks often expect the next number in a sequence, and no other task is specified, 14 is the most reasonable answer.",
