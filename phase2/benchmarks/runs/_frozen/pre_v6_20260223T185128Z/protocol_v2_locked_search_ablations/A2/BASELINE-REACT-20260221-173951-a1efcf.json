    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [1, 1, 5, 5]. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the four numbers (each exactly once) and basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to make 24. Let's explore possible combinations.\n\nWe have two 1s and two 5s.\n\nTry: (5 + 5) \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 10 \u00d7 2 = 20 \u2192 too low.\n\nTry: 5 \u00d7 5 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 = 25 \u2212 2 = 23 \u2192 close.\n\nTry: 5 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 1/5)? Wait, we only have two 1s, not a 1/5 unless we make it: 1 \u00f7 5 = 0.2, but we have two 1s and",

So maybe (5 \u00d7 5) \u2212 (1 \u00d7 1) = 25 \u2212 1 = 24. Yes! That uses all four numbers exactly once: two 5s and two 1s.\n\nCheck: 5 \u00d7 5 = 25; 1 \u00d7 1 = 1; 25 \u2212 1 = 24. Perfect.\n\nNo need for calculator yet \u2014 this is a valid arithmetic expression using only +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses.\n\nSo the solution is: (5 \u00d7 5)",
