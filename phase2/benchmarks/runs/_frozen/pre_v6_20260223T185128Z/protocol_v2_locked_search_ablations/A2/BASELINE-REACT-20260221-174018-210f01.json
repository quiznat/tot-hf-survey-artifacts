    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [3, 8, 10, 10] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer what the goal might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve computing a result like sum, product, or applying some operation. Given the numbers [3, 8, 10, 10], perhaps the goal is to compute something like the sum (3+8+10+10 = 31), or maybe a more complex expression. However, without explicit instructions, I should try a straightforward operation first \u2014 perhaps the sum. Let me use the `calc` tool to compute the sum.\n\nACTION: calc 3 + 8 + 10 + 10",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The result of the sum 3 + 8 + 10 + 10 is 31. However, benchmark tasks with number lists like [3, 8, 10, 10] often involve more specific operations \u2014 for example, using each number exactly once with arithmetic operations to reach a target (like 24 game), or computing something like product, average, or a custom formula. Since no target or operation was specified, and the sum gave 31, I should consider if other interpretations are more likely. Let\u2019s consider the product: 3 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 2400 \u2014 too large. Average: 31 / 4 = 7.75. Alternatively, maybe it's about combining numbers with operations to reach a known benchmark (e.g., 24). Let\u2019s test if 24 is achievable:",
