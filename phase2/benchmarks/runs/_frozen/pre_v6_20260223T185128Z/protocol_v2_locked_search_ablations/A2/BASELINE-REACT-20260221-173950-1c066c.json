    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [2, 3, 3, 9]. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the numbers 2, 3, 3, and 9 with arithmetic operations to reach 24. Let me consider possible combinations.\n\nFirst, note that 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, and 27 \u2212 3 = 24, but we still have a 2 left. So that doesn\u2019t work directly.\n\nWhat about (9 \u2212 3) \u00d7 (3 + 2) = 6 \u00d7 5 = 30 \u2014 too high.\n\n(9 + 3) \u00d7 (3 \u2212 2) = 12 \u00d7 1 = 12 \u2014 too low.\n\n9 \u00d7 (3 \u2212 2/3) = 9 \u00d7 (7/3) = 21 \u2014 no.\n\nWait: 3",

Try using division or grouping differently.\n\nNote: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, and 3 \u2212 2 = 1, so 27 \u2212 3 = 24 but we used only three numbers. Wait\u2014we must use all four numbers exactly once.\n\nWhat about (9 \u2212 3) \u00d7 3 + 2 = 6 \u00d7 3 + 2 = 18 + 2 = 20 \u2014 no.\n\n(9 + 3) \u00d7 2 \u2212 3 = 12 \u00d7 2 \u2212 3 = 24 \u2212 3 = 21 \u2014 close.\n\n9 \u00d7 2 + 3 + 3 = 18 + 6 = 24!

The operations are multiplication and addition, which are allowed in standard 24-game rules. No further calculation is needed \u2014 the expression evaluates to 24.",
