    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [1, 1, 2, 10], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation or goal is given, I need to infer what might be expected. Common benchmark tasks with lists of numbers include computing a sum, product, or perhaps evaluating an expression. Given the numbers [1, 1, 2, 10], a plausible interpretation is to compute their sum: 1 + 1 + 2 + 10 = 14. Alternatively, maybe it's a sequence (e.g., Fibonacci-like), but 1, 1, 2, 10 doesn\u2019t follow standard patterns. Another idea: perhaps the numbers represent operands and operators in some encoded form, but no operators are given. Since the only tool is `calc`, I should try evaluating a simple expression.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [1, 1, 2, 10], and the only tool available is `calc`, which likely evaluates arithmetic expressions. Since no explicit operation is specified, common benchmark tasks with such inputs often involve computing the sum, product, or evaluating a standard expression like concatenating digits or applying operations in order. Let\u2019s try computing the sum first: 1 + 1 + 2 + 10 = 14. Alternatively, maybe it's meant to be evaluated as a sequence of operations, e.g., ((1 + 1) * 2) + 10 = 14 as well. Or perhaps 1*1 + 2*10 = 21. But without more context, the simplest and most likely interpretation is the sum. I\u2019ll use `calc` to compute the sum directly.\nACTION: calc 1 + 1 + 2 + 1",

I need to correct this and compute the sum of the actual numbers: 1 + 1 + 2 + 10 = 14. I should use `calc` again with the correct expression.\nACTION: calc 1 + 1 + 2 + 10",
