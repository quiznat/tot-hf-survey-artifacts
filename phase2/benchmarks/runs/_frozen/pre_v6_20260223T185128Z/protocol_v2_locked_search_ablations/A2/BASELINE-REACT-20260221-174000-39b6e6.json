    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [4, 4, 4, 9], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., \"make 24\"), I need to infer the likely objective \u2014 a common puzzle with four numbers is to reach 24 using arithmetic operations. Let's test if [4, 4, 4, 9] can make 24.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 4 \u00d7 4 + 4 + 4 = 24? That's 16 + 4 + 4 = 24, but we have three 4s and a 9, not four 4s.\n- With 4, 4, 4, 9:\n  - 9 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21 \u2192 too low.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's explore more combinations. Since 9 is close to 8 (2\u00b3) or 12 (3\u00d74), maybe multiplication helps. Try:  \n- 4 \u00d7 (9 - 4) + 4 = 4 \u00d7 5 + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24 \u2192 uses all numbers: 4, 9, 4, 4. Yes! That's valid: 4 \u00d7 (9 - 4) + 4 = 24.  \nNow I need to compute this using the `calc` tool to verify. The expression is `4 * (9 - 4) + 4`.  \nACTION: calc 4 * (9 - 4) + 4",
