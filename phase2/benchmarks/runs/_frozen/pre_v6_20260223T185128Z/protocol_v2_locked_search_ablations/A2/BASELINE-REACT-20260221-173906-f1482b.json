    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is a list of numbers: [2, 5, 6, 6]. The only available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., \"make 24\"), I need to infer the task \u2014 possibly the classic \"24 game\", where the goal is to use all numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24.\n\nLet me try to find an expression using 2, 5, 6, 6 that equals 24.\n\nTry:  \n6 \u00d7 5 = 30  \n30 \u2212 6 = 24  \nBut we still have 2 unused.
