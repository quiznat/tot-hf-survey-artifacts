Common tasks with such inputs include computing the mean (average), which would be 15 / 4 = 3.75. Alternatively, the mode is 4 (appears twice), and the median is also 4 (average of 4 and 4).

In many standard benchmark tasks involving lists of numbers \u2014 especially in coding or math challenges \u2014 the most common default request is to compute the **sum**. Additionally, the sum is an integer and often the expected output in such contexts unless otherwise specified (e.g., \"average\", \"mean\", \"median\", etc.).
