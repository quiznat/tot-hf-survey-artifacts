    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 4, 5, 10]. The available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since the task is not explicitly specified, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with a list of numbers include computing the sum, product, average, or identifying a pattern. Given the numbers 2, 4, 5, 10, a plausible interpretation is to compute the sum: 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 21. Alternatively, maybe it's to compute the product: 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10 = 400. Or perhaps find the least common multiple (LCM) or greatest common divisor (GCD). Without explicit instructions, the most straightforward and common operation is the sum. I'll use `calc` to compute the sum.\n\nACTION: calc",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: error: unsafe expression",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `calc` tool returned an \"unsafe expression\" error, meaning it likely has restrictions on what expressions it accepts\u2014perhaps only simple arithmetic with two operands, or specific formatting. My previous attempt to compute the sum of four numbers in one expression may have triggered this. I should break it down into smaller steps: first add two numbers, then add the next, and so on. Let me try adding 2 and 4 first.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 4",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The first addition (2 + 4) succeeded and returned 6. Now I need to continue building the sum by adding the next number, 5, to the intermediate result 6. So I'll compute 6 + 5.\n\nACTION: calc 6 + 5",

    "STEP 5 MODEL: THINK: The previous step attempted to compute 11 + 10, but the observation says \"no-action\", which suggests the tool didn\u2019t execute or respond. This may indicate that the `calc` tool expects only two operands and a single operator, and perhaps the expression was accepted but no output was returned\u2014unlikely. More plausibly, the system expects me to explicitly provide the action again. Since 11 + 10 = 21 is straightforward, I should re-issue the action to compute it.\n\nACTION: calc 11 + 10",
