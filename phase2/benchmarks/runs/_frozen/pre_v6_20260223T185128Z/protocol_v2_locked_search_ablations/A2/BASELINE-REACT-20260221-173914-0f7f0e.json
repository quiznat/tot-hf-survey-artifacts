    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop with input [6, 6, 8, 9] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to combine the numbers [6, 6, 8, 9] using arithmetic operations to reach a target (e.g., 24 game). Let me assume the goal is to make 24 using all four numbers exactly once.\n\nAvailable numbers: 6, 6, 8, 9  \nTry combinations:\n\n- 9 - 6 = 3  \n- 8 - 6 = 2  \n- 3 \u00d7 8 = 24?
