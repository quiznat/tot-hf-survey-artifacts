    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [4, 7, 9, 10]. The available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. However, the task description doesn\u2019t specify what operation to perform on the numbers. Common benchmark tasks with such inputs might involve computing the sum, product, average, or checking for some property (e.g., is there a pair that sums to a target?). Since no target or operation is given, I should consider the most straightforward interpretation: perhaps compute the sum.\n\nLet me try calculating the sum using `calc`.\n\nACTION: calc 4 + 7 + 9 + 10",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the numbers [4, 7, 9, 10] is 30, as confirmed by the `calc` tool. However, I should consider whether other operations might be intended\u2014e.g., product, average, or something else. Since the task is ambiguous and no specific operation is given, and sum is the most common default for such lists in benchmark tasks, 30 is a reasonable answer. I\u2019ll proceed with this unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\nFINAL: 30"
