    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 4, 5, 10]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer what might be expected. Common benchmark tasks with lists include computing sum, product, average, finding patterns, or checking properties (e.g., divisibility, primes). Given the numbers, I notice:\n- 2, 4, 10 are even; 5 is odd.\n- 2 and 5 are prime; 4 and 10 are composite.\n- 2 \u00d7 5 = 10, and 4 = 2\u00b2 \u2014 possible multiplicative relationships.\n\nBut without a clear instruction, the safest default is to compute the sum, as it's the most basic arithmetic operation. Let me compute the sum: 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 21.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the task is to compute",

In benchmark tasks, when a list of numbers is provided without context, common expectations include computing the sum, product, average, or identifying a pattern. Observing the numbers: 2, 4, 5, 10 \u2014 note that 2 \u00d7 5 = 10, and 4 = 2\u00b2, suggesting possible multiplicative relationships. However, the most standard default operation for such inputs is the sum. Let me compute it using the calc tool to ensure accuracy.",
