    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [2, 2, 8, 8], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the numbers [2, 2, 8, 8] with arithmetic operations to reach 24 (a common benchmark). Let me try to find such an expression.\n\nPossible approaches:\n- 8 \u00d7 (2 + 2) = 32 \u2192 too high\n- (8 + 8) + (2 + 2) = 20 \u2192 too low\n- 8 \u00d7 2 + 8 \u00f7 2 = 16 + 4 = 20\n- (8 \u00d7 2) + (8 + 2) = 16 + 10 = 26\n- (8 +",

Try division/multiplication differently: 8 \u00d7 (8 \u00f7 2 - 2) = 8 \u00d7 (4 - 2) = 8 \u00d7 2 = 16. Hmm. Try (8 \u00d7 8) \u00f7 (2 + 2) = 64 \u00f7 4 = 16. Still 16. Wait \u2014 what about (8 - 2) \u00d7 (8 - 2) = 6 \u00d7 6 = 36. Too high. (8 \u00f7 2) \u00d7 (8 - 2",
