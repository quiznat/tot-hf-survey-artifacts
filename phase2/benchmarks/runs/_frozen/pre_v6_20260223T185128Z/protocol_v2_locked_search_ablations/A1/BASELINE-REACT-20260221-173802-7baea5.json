    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [4, 4, 4, 10], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the numbers [4, 4, 4, 10] with arithmetic operations to reach 24 (a common benchmark). Let me try to reason about possible combinations.\n\nWe have three 4s and one 10.\n\nTry:  \n- 4 \u00d7 4 = 16  \n- 16 + 4 = 20  \n- 20 + 10 = 30 \u2192 too high  \n- 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22  \n- 10 \u00d7 4 = 40; 40 - 4 - 4 = 32",

Maybe using division or parentheses.  \nTry: (10 - 4) \u00d7 4 - 4 = 6 \u00d7 4 - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 \u2192 no.  \nTry: (4 + 4) \u00d7 (10 - 4) = 8 \u00d7 6 = 48 \u2192 too high.  \nTry: 4 \u00d7 (10 - 4) = 24 \u2014 but that uses only two numbers (4 and 10 and one 4), leaving one 4 unused. Need to use all four numbers exactly once.  \nWait: 4 \u00d7 (10 - 4) = 24, and we have a third 4. Can we incorporate it without changing the result? Maybe: 4 \u00d7 (10 - 4) + (4 - 4) = 2",

Try using division or grouping differently.\n\nTry: (10 \u00d7 4 - 4 \u00d7 4) = 40 - 16 = 24 \u2014 yes! That uses all four numbers: 10, 4, 4, 4. Specifically: 10 \u00d7 4 = 40, 4 \u00d7 4 = 16, 40 \u2212 16 = 24.\n\nSo expression: 10 * 4 - 4 * 4 = 24.\n\nLet me verify with calc tool.\nACTION: calc 10 * 4 - 4 * 4\nFINAL: 24",
