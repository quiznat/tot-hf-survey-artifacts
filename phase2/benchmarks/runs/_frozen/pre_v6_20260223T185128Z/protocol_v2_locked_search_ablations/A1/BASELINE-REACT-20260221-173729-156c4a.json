    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [4, 6, 7, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve computing an aggregate (e.g., sum, product, average), or checking properties (e.g., if numbers can form a valid expression to reach 24). Given the numbers [4, 6, 7, 7], a classic 24 Game-style problem is plausible. Let me try to compute the sum first as a baseline.\n\nSum = 4 + 6 + 7 + 7 = 24. That\u2019s a clean result and matches the classic 24 target. So likely the task is to verify or compute the sum.\n\nI\u2019ll use the `calc` tool to compute the sum.\n\nACTION: calc 4 +",
