    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [2, 3, 9, 9] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer what operation to perform. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing sum, product, or applying arithmetic operations in sequence. Given the numbers [2, 3, 9, 9], a plausible goal is to combine them using arithmetic operations to reach a target (e.g., 24 game), but no target is specified. Alternatively, maybe compute the sum: 2 + 3 + 9 + 9 = 23. Or product: 2 * 3 * 9 * 9 = 486. Since the tool is `calc`, I should try evaluating an expression. Let me try computing the sum first as a baseline.  \nACTION: calc 2 + 3",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 5",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The previous action computed 2 + 3 = 5. Now I need to continue combining the remaining numbers [9, 9] with the intermediate result. If the goal is to compute the total sum, next step is 5 + 9 = 14, then 14 + 9 = 23. Alternatively, maybe the task is to reach 24 (classic 24 game). Let\u2019s test: 2, 3, 9, 9 \u2192 try (9 - 3) * (9 - 2) = 6 * 7 = 42 (no), (9 / 3) * (9 - 2) = 3 * 7 = 21, (9 + 9) + (3 + 2) = 23, (9 * 3) - (9 / 2) = 27 -",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The task is ambiguous, but given the input [2, 3, 9, 9] and the `calc` tool, a common benchmark is the 24 Game \u2014 using all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7 and parentheses to make 24. Let\u2019s test possible combinations:  \n- (9 \u2212 3) \u00d7 (9 \u2212 2) = 6 \u00d7 7 = 42 \u274c  \n- (9 + 9) + (3 + 2) = 23 \u274c  \n- 9 \u00d7 3 \u2212 9 \u2212 2 = 27 \u2212 11 = 16 \u274c  \n- (9 \u00d7 2) + (9 \u2212 3) = 18 + 6 = 24 \u2705  \nYes! 9 \u00d7 2 + (9 \u2212 3) = 18",

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: The task is likely the 24 Game: using [2, 3, 9, 9] exactly once with arithmetic operations to reach 24. I found a valid expression: 9 \u00d7 2 + (9 \u2212 3) = 18 + 6 = 24.
