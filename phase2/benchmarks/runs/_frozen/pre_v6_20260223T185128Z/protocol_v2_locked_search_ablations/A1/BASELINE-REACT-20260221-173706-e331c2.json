    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [2, 5, 6, 6], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, the most likely benchmark task is to compute the result of applying arithmetic operations to reach 24 (the classic 24 game). Let's check if [2, 5, 6, 6] can make 24.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- 6 \u00d7 5 - 6 + 2 = 30 - 6 + 2 = 26 \u2192 no\n- 6 \u00d7 (5 - 2/6) = 6 \u00d7 (5 - 1/3) = 6 \u00d7 (14/3) = 28 \u2192 no\n- (6 + 6) \u00d7 (5 - 2) = 12 \u00d7 3 =",

From STEP 1, I tried (6 + 6) \u00d7 (5 \u2212 2) = 12 \u00d7 3 = 36 \u2014 too high. Let\u2019s try other combinations. Try 6 \u00d7 5 = 30, then 30 \u2212 6 = 24, but we still have 2 unused. Need to incorporate all four numbers. Try (6 \u00d7 6) \u2212 (5 + 2) = 36 \u2212 7 = 29. Try (6 + 6) \u00d7 2 = 24, but then 5 is unused. Need to use all four numbers. Try division: 6 \u00f7 6",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Let's systematically explore valid expressions using all four numbers [2, 5, 6, 6] exactly once with basic operations to reach 24. From earlier attempts, (6 + 6) \u00d7 2 = 24 uses only three numbers (two 6s and 2), leaving 5 unused \u2014 invalid. Try incorporating 5 via multiplication by 1: e.g., ((6 + 6) \u00d7 2) \u00d7 (6 \u00f7 6) but we only have two 6s, and 5 is still missing. Wait \u2014 numbers are [2, 5, 6, 6], so only one 5. Try: 6 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 2/6). Compute 2/6 = 1/3, so 5 \u2212 1/3 = 14/3, then 6 \u00d7 14/3 =",

Try another: (6 \u00d7 5) \u2212 (6 \u00f7 2) = 30 \u2212 3 = 27. Close. Try (6 \u00d7 5) \u2212 6 + 2 = 30 \u2212 6 + 2 = 26. Still off. Try (6 + 6) \u00d7 2 = 24, but need to include 5.

Try (6 + 6) \u00d7 (5 \u2212 2) = 12 \u00d7 3 = 36 \u2014 too high. What about division? Try 6 \u00d7 (6 \u2212 2) \u2212 5 = 6 \u00d7 4 \u2212 5 = 24 \u2212 5 = 19.
