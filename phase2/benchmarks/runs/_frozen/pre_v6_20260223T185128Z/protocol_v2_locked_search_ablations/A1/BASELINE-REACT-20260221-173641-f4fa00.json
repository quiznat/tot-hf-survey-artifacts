However, the task is not explicitly stated \u2014 it's a benchmark task, so I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with lists include computing sum, product, mean, etc. Since only `calc` is available, I should try a simple operation first. Let me try computing the sum using `calc`.\n\nACTION: calc 1 + 3 + 4 + 5",
