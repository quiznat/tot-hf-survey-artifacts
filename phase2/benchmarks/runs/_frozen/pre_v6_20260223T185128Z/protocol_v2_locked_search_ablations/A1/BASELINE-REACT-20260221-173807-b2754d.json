    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [3, 6, 6, 9]. Since the only available tool is `calc`, and the numbers sum to exactly 24 (3 + 6 + 6 + 9 = 24), this strongly resembles the classic 24 game \u2014 where the goal is to use all numbers exactly once with arithmetic operations to reach 24. However, the sum alone already gives 24, so the simplest valid expression is just the sum. Alternatively, other combinations may exist (e.g., (9 \u2212 6) \u00d7 (6 + 2) \u2014 but 2 isn\u2019t available), so the direct sum is valid and uses all numbers. Since the task likely expects a single numerical answer, and the sum is 24, that is the most straightforward result. I should compute it using `calc` to confirm.",

Since the only tool available is `calc`, I should use it to compute the sum to confirm. Alternatively, the task may simply ask for the sum, average, or another aggregate \u2014 but sum is most direct and matches the benchmark pattern.
