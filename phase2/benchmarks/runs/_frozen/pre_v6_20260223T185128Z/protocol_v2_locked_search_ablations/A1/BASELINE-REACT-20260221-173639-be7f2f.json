    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop with input [3, 3, 6, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to combine the numbers [3, 3, 6, 7] using arithmetic operations to reach a target (e.g., 24 game). Let me try to find an expression using all four numbers exactly once to reach 24.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- 7 - 3 = 4; 6 / 3 = 2; 4 * 6 = 24? Wait, need to use all four numbers.\n- Try: (7 - 3) * (6) = 24, but that uses only 7, 3, 6 \u2014 missing one 3.\n- Try: (7 - 3/3) *",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task likely involves using the numbers [3, 3, 6, 7] exactly once with arithmetic operations to reach a target, commonly 24 (classic 24 game). From STEP 1, I tried (7 - 3) * 6 = 24 but missed one 3. Need to incorporate both 3s. Let\u2019s explore:  \n- 3 + 3 = 6; then 7 - 6 = 1; 6 * 1 = 6 \u2014 no.  \n- 7 * 3 = 21; 6 / 3 = 2; 21 + 2 = 23 \u2014 close.  \n- 7 * 3 = 21; 3 + 6 = 9 \u2014 too big.  \n- Try: (7 + 3) * (3 - 6/6)?

A promising path:  \n- 6 / 3 = 2  \n- 7 - 2 = 5  \n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2014 not 24.  \nTry multiplication first:  \n- 3 * 3 = 9  \n- 9 + 7 = 16  \n- 16 + 6 = 22 \u2014 no.  \n- 7 * 3 = 21, 21 + 3 = 24, then 24 ? 6 \u2014 need to use 6.  \nWait \u2014 what if we do: (7 - 3/3) * 6 / ?
