    "STEP 1 MODEL: Thought 1: We are given numbers [5, 14, 19, 19, 19] and need to reach target 57 using arithmetic operations (implied by benchmark tasks like 24 game). Let's check if simple sum works: 5 + 14 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 76, too high. Try combinations: 19 \u00d7 3 = 57. We have three 19s! So 19 + 19 + 19 = 57. That uses three numbers, and the remaining numbers (5 and 14) are unused \u2014 but benchmark tasks usually require using all numbers? Not always \u2014 depends on rules. However, many variants allow using a subset. Since 19+19+19 = 57 exactly, and we have three 19s, this is valid. If all numbers must be used, we\u2019d need to incorporate 5 and 14 in a neutral way (e.g., \u00d71 or +0), but no tools or operations are specified, and no way to make 0 or 1 from 5 and 14 without extra numbers. So likely subset usage is allowed.  \nAction 1: Finish[57]"
