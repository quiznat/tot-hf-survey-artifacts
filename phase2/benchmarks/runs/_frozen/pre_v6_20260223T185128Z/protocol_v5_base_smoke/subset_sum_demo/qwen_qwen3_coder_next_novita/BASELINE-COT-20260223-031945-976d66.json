    "PROMPT: Select one or more values from the provided list so their sum equals the target.\nNumbers: [5, 14, 19, 19, 19]\nTarget: 57\nRules:\n- You may use each listed number at most once.\n- Return only a comma-separated list of chosen numbers (example: 4,9,2).\n- Do not include explanation text.\n\nThink step by step before answering.\nEnd with exactly one line:\nFINAL: <answer>\n",
    "OUTPUT: We are given the list: [5, 14, 19, 19, 19]  \nTarget: 57  \nWe may use each number at most once.\n\nLet\u2019s consider combinations:\n\n- Try three 19s: 19 + 19 + 19 = 57 \u2192 \u2705 matches target exactly.\n\nWe have three 19s available, so this is valid.\n\nAny other combinations? Let\u2019s check quickly:\n\n- 19 + 19 + 14 = 52 \u2192 too low  \n- 19 + 19 + 5 = 43  \n- 19 + 14 + 5 = 38  \n- 14 + 5 = 19  \n- All five: 5 + 14 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 76 \u2192 too high  \n- Two 19s + 14 + 5 = 57? 19+19=38, +14=52, +5=57 \u2192 \u2705 also works!\n\nWait \u2014 19 + 19 + 14 + 5 = 57  \nThat\u2019s four numbers: two 19s, 14, and 5.\n\nBut we have three 19s, so using two is allowed.\n\nSo we have at least two valid subsets:\n1. 19, 19, 19  \n2. 19, 19, 14, 5\n\nBut the problem says: \u201cSelect one or more values...\u201d and \u201cReturn only a comma-separated list of chosen numbers.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t say to find *all* solutions \u2014 just *a* solution.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nWhich one to pick? Let\u2019s verify both:\n\n- 19 + 19 + 19 = 57 \u2714  \n- 19 + 19 + 14 + 5 = 57 \u2714\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut the instruction says: \u201cSelect one or more values from the provided list so their sum equals the target.\u201d So any valid subset is acceptable.\n\nWe should return one solution.\n\nLet\u2019s pick the simplest: three 19s.\n\nSo: 19,19,19\n\nNote: Since there are three 19s in the list, using all three is allowed",
