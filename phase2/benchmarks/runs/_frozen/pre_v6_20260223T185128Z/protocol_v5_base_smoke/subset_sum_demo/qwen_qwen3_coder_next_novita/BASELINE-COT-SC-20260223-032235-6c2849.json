    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the list: [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 22]  \nTarget: 17  \nWe need to select one or more numbers (each used at most once) that sum to 17.\n\nLet\u2019s try combinations:\n\nStart with smaller numbers:\n\n- 3 + 5 = 8  \n- 3 + 5 + 6 = 14  \n- 3 + 5 + 6 + 8 = 22 \u2192 too big  \n- 3 + 5 + 8 = 16  \n- 3 + 5 + 11 = 19 \u2192 too big  \n- 3 + 6 + 8 = 17 \u2705\n\nCheck: 3 + 6 + 8 = 17 \u2192 Yes.\n\nAny other combinations? Let\u2019s verify uniqueness and completeness.\n\n- 5 + 6 + 8 = 19  \n- 3 + 11 = 14  \n- 5 + 11 = 16  \n- 6 + 11 = 17 \u2705 \u2192 6 + 11 = 17  \nWait \u2014 6 + 11 = 17 \u2014 that\u2019s also valid.\n\nSo we have at least two valid solutions:\n- 3, 6, 8  \n- 6, 11  \n\nBut the instruction says: \u201cSelect one or more values\u201d \u2014 any valid solution is acceptable. We only need to return *one* (comma-separated list). So pick one.\n\nWhich one to choose? Let\u2019s see if the sample expects a specific format \u2014 it says \u201creturn only a comma-separated list of chosen numbers (example: 4,9,2)\u201d. So order probably doesn\u2019t matter, but typically ascending order is clean.\n\nOption 1: 3,6,8  \nOption 2: 6,11\n\nBoth are valid. Let\u2019s check if any other simple ones:\n\n- 5 + 12? No 12.  \n- 18,19,22 are too big individually (>17).  \n- 11 + 5 + 1? No 1.  \n- 3 + 14? No 14.  \nSo only two combos: (3,6,8) and (6,11).\n\nEither is fine. Let\u2019s",
