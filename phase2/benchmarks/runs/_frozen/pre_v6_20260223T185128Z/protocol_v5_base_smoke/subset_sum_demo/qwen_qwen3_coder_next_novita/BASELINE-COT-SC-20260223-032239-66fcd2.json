Available numbers: 2,7,11,... \u2014 5 not available. 2+7=9 too big, 2 alone=2 \u2192 48+2=50, 48+7=55 too big.\n\nTry 25 + 22 = 47 \u2192 need 6. 2+7=9 too big, 2 alone=2\u219249, 7 alone=7\u219254 too big.\n\n25 + 21 = 46 \u2192 need 7. 7 is available! So 25 + 21 + 7 = 53.\n\nCheck: 25 + 21 = 46, +7 = 53. Yes!\n\nAll numbers used once: 7, 21, 25 \u2014 all in list.\n\nSo answer: 7,21,25\n\nFINAL: 7,21,25",
