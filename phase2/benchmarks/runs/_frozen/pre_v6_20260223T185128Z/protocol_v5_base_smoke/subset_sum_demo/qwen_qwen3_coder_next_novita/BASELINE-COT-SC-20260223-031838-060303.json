Possibly, but the problem only asks for *one* valid selection (since it says \u201cselect one or more values\u201d and to return a comma-separated list of chosen numbers \u2014 not all solutions). So we can return 17,20.\n\nDouble-check other possible combos just in case:\n- 18 + 19 = 37 \u2192 18 + 19 = 37 \u2705  \nThere are two 19s in the list, so 18 + 19 is also possible (use one of the 19s). So 18,19 is also valid.\n\nSo two valid pairs: (17,20) and (18,19)\n\nWhich to pick? Either is acceptable. Let's pick one.\n\nLet\u2019s go with 18,19 \u2014 both present (18 once, 19 twice), so okay.\n\nBut wait \u2014 list: [10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 19, 20] \u2014 yes, 18 and 19 are present.\n\nSo both pairs work.\n\nWe need to return *only* the numbers, comma-separated.\n\nLet\u2019s choose 18,19 (smaller numbers? Doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 either is fine).\n\nAlternatively, could there",
