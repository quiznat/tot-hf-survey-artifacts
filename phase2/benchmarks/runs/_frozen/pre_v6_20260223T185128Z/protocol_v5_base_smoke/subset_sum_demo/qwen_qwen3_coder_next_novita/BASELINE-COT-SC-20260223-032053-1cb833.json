    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: Let's find a subset of the numbers [10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 19, 20] that sums to 37.\n\nFirst, note there are two 19s \u2014 we can use at most two if needed, but each instance only once.\n\nTry combinations:\n\n- 20 + 17 = 37 \u2192 yes! 20 + 17 = 37.\n\nCheck: 20 and 17 are both in the list, each appears once (20 appears once, 17 appears once).

The problem doesn\u2019t specify order, but sample shows ascending (e.g., 4,9,2 \u2014 not sorted, but usually ascending is fine). Let's sort ascending: 17,20.\n\nAlternatively, 18 + 19 = 37 \u2014 18 and one 19 are present. That\u2019s also valid: 18,19.\n\nWhich to pick? Either is fine.
