    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24]  \nTarget: 62  \nWe need to select a subset (each used at most once) that sums to 62.\n\nLet\u2019s try combinations.\n\nFirst, check total sum:  \n2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 =  \n2+6=8, +14=22, +18=40, +22=62, +24=86  \nSo total is 86. We need 62, so we need to exclude numbers summing to 86 \u2212 62 = 24.\n\nSo instead of finding a subset that sums to 62, we can find a subset to exclude that sums to 24 \u2014 and the remaining will sum to 62.\n\nWhich numbers sum to 24? Let\u2019s see:\n\n- 24 itself \u2192 exclude 24 \u2192 remaining sum = 86 \u2212 24 = 62 \u2705  \nSo remaining numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22]  \nCheck: 2+6=8, +14=22, +18=40, +22=62 \u2705\n\nSo one valid solution: 2,6,14,18,22\n\nAre there others? Let\u2019s check.\n\nOther subsets that sum to 24 (to exclude):\n\n- 2 + 22 = 24 \u2192 exclude 2 and 22 \u2192 remaining: 6,14,18,24  \nSum: 6+14=20, +18=38, +24=62 \u2705  \nSo 6,14,18,24 is another.\n\n- 6 + 18 = 24 \u2192 exclude 6 and 18 \u2192 remaining: 2,14,22,24  \nSum: 2+14=16, +22=38, +24=62 \u2705  \nSo 2,14,22,24 is another.\n\n- 2 + 6 + 14 + ? = 22, need 2 more \u2192 but 2 already used. 2+6+",
