    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 57 using the numbers [5, 14, 19, 19, 19]. Since 19 + 19 + 19 = 57, and the numbers include three 19s, this expression exactly achieves the target. The question is whether *all* numbers must be used. In standard \"24 Game\"-style benchmarks, the rule is usually to use *all* given numbers exactly once. However, some variants allow using a subset. Given that 5 and 14 are extra and don\u2019t obviously combine to zero (e.g., 14 \u2212 5 = 9, which doesn\u2019t help cancel), we should check if a solution using all five numbers exists.\n\nTry: (19 + 19 + 19) \u00d7 (14 \u2212 14) + 57 \u2014",

Standard benchmarks (e.g., from the \"24 Game\" family) typically require using *all* given numbers exactly once. Since 19 + 19 + 19 = 57 uses only three numbers, we must incorporate 5 and 14 in a way that doesn\u2019t change the result \u2014 e.g., by adding zero or multiplying by one.\n\nObserve: 14 \u2212 5 = 9, not helpful directly. But (14 \u2212 5 \u2212 9) = 0 \u2014 but we don\u2019t have a 9. Alternatively, consider (5 \u2212 5) = 0, but only one 5.\n\nWait \u2014 can we form 0 using 5 and 14 and some 19",
