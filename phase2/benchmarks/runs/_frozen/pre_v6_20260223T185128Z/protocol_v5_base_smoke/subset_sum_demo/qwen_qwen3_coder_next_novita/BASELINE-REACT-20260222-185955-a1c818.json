Since no tools are available, this is likely a puzzle where we need to combine numbers using arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, possibly parentheses), using each number at most once. A simple candidate: 21 + 9 = 30. We have two 9s, so we can use one 9 and the 21, leaving the rest unused \u2014 but many such puzzles require *all* numbers to be used exactly once. The problem statement doesn\u2019t specify whether all numbers must be used. Let\u2019s check both interpretations.\n\nInterpretation A: Use *some* numbers (at least one, typically at least two). Then 21 + 9 = 30 works.\n\nInter",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The problem statement does not explicitly require using all numbers, only to reach the target 30 using the given list. Since 21 + 9 = 30 and both 21 and 9 are in the list (and we have two 9s, so using one is valid), this is a valid solution. However, to be thorough, let\u2019s consider if a solution using *all* numbers is expected \u2014 but without explicit instructions, the minimal requirement is to reach the target, and 21 + 9 suffices.
