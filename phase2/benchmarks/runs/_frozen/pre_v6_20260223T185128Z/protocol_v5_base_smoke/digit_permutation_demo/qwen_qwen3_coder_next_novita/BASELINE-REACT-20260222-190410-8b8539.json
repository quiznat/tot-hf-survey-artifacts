    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (3) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [1, 3, 2, 9]. The oracle_max is 9321, which is the maximum possible number from those digits (9,3,2,1). We need to check if 9321 is divisible by 3. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation that is divisible by 3.\n\nDivisibility rule for 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nSum of digits = 1 + 3 + 2 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 so any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the largest permutation (9321) is divisible by 3.\n\nCheck: 9321 \u00f7 3 = 3",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the digits is 1 + 3 + 2 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, *any* permutation of these digits forms a number divisible by 3. The largest possible permutation of [1, 3, 2, 9] is 9321, which matches the oracle_max. Since 9321 is divisible by 3 (9321 \u00f7 3 = 3107, an integer), it satisfies the condition. No further checks or permutations are needed.\nFINAL: 9321"
