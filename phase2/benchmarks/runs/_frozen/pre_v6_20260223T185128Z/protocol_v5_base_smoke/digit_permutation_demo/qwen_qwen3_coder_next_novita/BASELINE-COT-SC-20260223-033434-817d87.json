    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given digits: [3, 0, 3, 0]  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using **each digit exactly once**, and the number must be **divisible by 5**.\n\n### Step 1: Understand divisibility by 5  \nA number is divisible by 5 if and only if its **last digit is 0 or 5**.  \nWe only have digits 3 and 0 \u2014 no 5 available.  \n\u2705 So the last digit **must be 0**.\n\nWe have two 0s, so that\u2019s possible.\n\n### Step 2: To maximize the number, we want the **largest digits in the highest place values** (thousands > hundreds > tens > units).  \nWe need to place:\n- Units digit = 0 (to satisfy divisibility by 5)\n- Remaining digits: [3, 3, 0] to fill thousands, hundreds, tens.\n\nWe want the largest possible number, so:\n- Thousands place: largest available digit \u2192 3  \n- Hundreds place: next largest \u2192 3  \n- Tens place: remaining digit \u2192 0  \n- Units: 0 (fixed)\n\nSo candidate number: **3300**\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n- Uses digits: 3, 3, 0, 0 \u2705  \n- 4-digit number \u2705  \n- Ends in 0 \u21d2 divisible by 5 \u2705  \n- Is there a larger arrangement?\n\nOther possible placements ending in 0:\n- 3030 \u2192 smaller than 3300  \n- 3003 \u2192 ends in 3 \u21d2 not divisible by 5 \u274c  \n- 0330 \u2192 not 4-digit (starts with 0) \u274c  \n- 0303 \u2192 not 4-digit \u274c  \n- 0033 \u2192 not 4-digit \u274c  \n- 3030 vs 3300: 3300 > 3030  \n- What about 3300 vs 3030 vs 3003 (invalid) \u2014 yes, 3300 is largest valid.\n\n\u2705 So the largest possible is **3300**.\n\nFINAL: 3300",
