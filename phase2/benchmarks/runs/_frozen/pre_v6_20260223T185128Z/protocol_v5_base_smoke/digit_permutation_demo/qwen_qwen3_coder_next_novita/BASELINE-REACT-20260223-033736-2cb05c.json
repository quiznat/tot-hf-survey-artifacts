    "STEP 1 MODEL: Thought 1: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 6 that can be formed by rearranging the digits [9, 1, 3, 8]. The oracle_max is given as 9318, which suggests that's the correct answer. Let's verify:  \n- A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 8 (only even digit in [9,1,3,8]).  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits = 9+1+3+8 = 21, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 any permutation is divisible by 3.  \nSo we just need the largest permutation ending in 8. Arrange remaining digits [9,1,3] in descending order: 9,3,1 \u2192 9318. That matches oracle_max.  \nThus, the answer is 9318.\n\nAction 1: Finish[9318]"
