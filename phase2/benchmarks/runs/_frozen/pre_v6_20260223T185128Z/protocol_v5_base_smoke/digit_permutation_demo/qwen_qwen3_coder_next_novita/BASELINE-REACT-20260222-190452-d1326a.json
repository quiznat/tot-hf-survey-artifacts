    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 3, 3, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle_max is 3336. Let's recall the divisibility rule for 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nWe have digits: 6, 3, 3, 3. So all permutations of these digits are numbers like 6333, 3633, 3363, 3336.\n\nLet\u2019s list all distinct permutations (since three 3s are identical, there are only 4 distinct numbers):\n\n- 6333 \u2192 last three digits: 333 \u2192 333 \u00f7 8 = 41.625 \u2192 not divisible",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continue evaluating the remaining permutations. Next: 3633 \u2192 last three digits: 633 \u2192 633 \u00f7 8 = 79.125 \u2192 not divisible. Next: 3363 \u2192 last three digits: 363 \u2192 363 \u00f7 8 = 45.375 \u2192 not divisible. Next: 3336 \u2192 last three digits: 336 \u2192 336 \u00f7 8 = 42 \u2192 divisible! So 3336 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle_max is 3336, and it's the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending: 6,3,3,3 \u2192 6333 is largest, but not divisible; next is 3633, etc., down to 3336), and 3",
