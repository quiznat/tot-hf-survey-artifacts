    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given digits: [1, 9, 0, 8]  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using each digit **exactly once**, such that the number is **divisible by 6**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding divisibility by 6  \nA number is divisible by 6 **iff** it is divisible by both **2** and **3**.\n\n- **Divisible by 2** \u2192 last digit must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).  \n  Our available even digits: **0, 8**\n\n- **Divisible by 3** \u2192 sum of digits must be divisible by 3.  \n  Sum = 1 + 9 + 0 + 8 = **18**, which is divisible by 3. \u2705  \n  So any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3.  \n  Therefore, we only need to enforce **divisibility by 2**, i.e., last digit \u2208 {0, 8}.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the largest possible 4-digit number with these digits, ending in 0 or 8.\n\nTo maximize the number, we want the **largest digits first**, i.e., descending order, but constrained by last digit being even.\n\nAll digits: 9, 8, 1, 0  \nTry to place **largest possible digits in the thousands, hundreds, tens**, etc.\n\n#### Case 1: Last digit = 0  \nThen remaining digits: 9, 8, 1  \nLargest arrangement: 9810  \n\u2192 9810 is divisible by 2 (ends in 0) and sum = 18 \u21d2 divisible by 3 \u21d2 divisible by 6 \u2705\n\n#### Case 2: Last digit = 8  \nRemaining digits: 9, 1, 0  \nLargest arrangement: 9108  \n\u2192 Ends in 8 \u21d2 even \u2705  \nSum = 18 \u21d2 divisible by 3 \u2705  \nSo 9108 is also divisible by 6.\n\nCompare 9810 vs 9108 \u2192 9810 is larger.\n\nAny other combinations with last digit 0?  \nTry 9081 \u2192 ends in 1 (odd) \u274c  \nOnly permutations ending in 0 or 8 matter.\n\nLet\u2019s list all",
