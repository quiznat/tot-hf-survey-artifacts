    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given digits: [6, 3, 3, 3]  \nWe need to form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using **each digit exactly once**, and it must be **divisible by 8**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand divisibility by 8  \nA number is divisible by 8 if its **last three digits** form a number divisible by 8.\n\nSo, for a 4-digit number `ABCD`, the number formed by `BCD` must be divisible by 8.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: List all permutations of the digits [6, 3, 3, 3]  \nSince there are repeated digits (three 3s), the distinct permutations are limited.\n\nWe can generate all unique 4-digit numbers using digits 6, 3, 3, 3:\n\n- 6333  \n- 3633  \n- 3363  \n- 3336  \n\nThat\u2019s all \u2014 only 4 distinct numbers (since 3 repeated 3 times, number of distinct permutations = 4! / 3! = 4).\n\nLet\u2019s list them in descending order (since we want the **largest** possible):\n\n1. **6333**  \n2. **3633**  \n3. **3363**  \n4. **3336**\n\nNow test each for divisibility by 8.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Check divisibility by 8 (check last 3 digits)\n\n- **6333**: last 3 digits = **333**  \n  333 \u00f7 8 = 41.625 \u2192 not divisible  \n- **3633**: last 3 digits = **633**  \n  633 \u00f7 8 = 79.125 \u2192 not divisible  \n- **3363**: last 3 digits = **363**  \n  363 \u00f7 8 = 45.375 \u2192 not divisible  \n- **3336**: last 3 digits = **336**  \n  336 \u00f7 8 = **42** \u2192 \u2705 divisible!\n\nSo only **3336** works.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there any larger number?
