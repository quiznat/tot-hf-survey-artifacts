    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the digits [6, 6, 8, 4]. The oracle_max is given as 8664, which suggests that 8664 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if it's indeed the maximum possible number divisible by 4 using those digits.\n\nA number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nDigits available: [6, 6, 8, 4]\n\nWe want the largest possible number, so we should try to arrange digits in descending order as much as possible, while ensuring divisibility by 4.\n\nAll permutations of [6,6,8,4] in descending order would start with 8664.\n\nLet\u2019s check 8664:\n- Last two digits: 64",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: 64 \u00f7 4 = 16, so 64 is divisible by 4 \u2192 8664 is divisible by 4. Now, is 8664 the largest possible number we can form? Let's consider all permutations in descending order:\n\n- Largest possible arrangement: 8664 (digits sorted descending: 8,6,6,4)\n- Next candidates would be smaller (e.g., 8646, 8466, etc.)\n\nSince 8664 uses all digits and is divisible by 4, and no larger permutation exists (as any other arrangement would be lexicographically smaller), 8664 is indeed the maximum.\n\nThe oracle_max matches this, confirming correctness.\n\nFINAL: 8664"
