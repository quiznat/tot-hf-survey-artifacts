    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (6) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [1, 9, 0, 8]. The oracle_max is given as 9810, which suggests that 9810 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if 9810 is indeed divisible by 6 and can be formed from the digits [1, 9, 0, 8].\n\nFirst, check if 9810 uses exactly the digits [1, 9, 0, 8]:\n- Digits in 9810: 9, 8, 1, 0 \u2192 matches [1, 9, 0, 8] (order doesn\u2019t matter). \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNext, check divisibility by 6:\n- A number divisible by 6 must be divisible by both",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: A number divisible by 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even. 9810 ends in 0 \u2192 even \u2714\ufe0f  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9 + 8 + 1 + 0 = 18, and 18 \u00f7 3 = 6 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2714\ufe0f  \nThus, 9810 is divisible by 6. Since it uses exactly the digits [1, 9, 0, 8] and is the largest possible permutation (9810 is the descending order of the digits), and the oracle confirms it as the maximum, it is the correct answer.",
