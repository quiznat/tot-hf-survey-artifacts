    "STEP 1 MODEL: Thought 1: We are given digits [4, 2, 2, 4] and need to form the largest possible number divisible by 11. The oracle_max is 4422, which suggests that 4422 is the correct answer \u2014 but we must verify that 4422 is divisible by 11 and that it's the largest such number formed from those digits.\n\nCheck divisibility by 11: For a number, compute alternating sum of digits: (sum of digits in odd positions) \u2212 (sum of digits in even positions). For 4422:\nPositions (1-indexed): 1\u21924, 2\u21924, 3\u21922, 4\u21922  \nOdd positions (1st & 3rd): 4 + 2 = 6  \nEven positions (2nd & 4th): 4 + 2 = 6  \nDifference = 6 \u2212 6 = 0 \u2192 divisible by 11 \u2705\n\nNow, is 4422 the largest permutation of [4,2,2,4] divisible by 11? All permutations of [4,2,2,4] sorted descending: 4422, 4242, 4224, 2442, 2424, 2244.\n\nCheck each descending:\n- 4422: as above, divisible \u2705  \n\u2192 Since it's the largest permutation and divisible, it's the answer.\n\nAction 1: Finish[4422]"
