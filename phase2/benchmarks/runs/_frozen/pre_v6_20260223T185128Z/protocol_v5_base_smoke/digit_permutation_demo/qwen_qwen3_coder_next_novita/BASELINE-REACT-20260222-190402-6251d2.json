    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [2, 5, 7, 6]. The oracle_max is 7652, which is likely the maximum possible number formed by those digits (7652), but we need the largest *divisible by 4* number \u2264 7652.\n\nRecall: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nWe have digits: 2, 5, 6, 7.\n\nWe want the largest possible number (so start from descending order: 7652, then 7625, etc.) that is divisible by 4.\n\nLet\u2019s list permutations in descending order and check divisibility by 4:\n\nStart with 7652:\n- Last two digits: 5",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 7652, last two digits are \"52\", not \"5\" \u2014 I misread. 52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so 52 is divisible by 4. Therefore, 7652 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle_max is 7652 and it satisfies the divisibility condition, it must be the answer. Let\u2019s verify: digits used are 7,6,5,2 \u2014 matches [2,5,7,6]. Yes. So the largest number divisible by 4 is 7652.",
