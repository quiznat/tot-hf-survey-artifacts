    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by rearranging the digits [4, 2, 2, 4] that is divisible by 11, and the oracle says the maximum is 4422. Let's verify if 4422 is divisible by 11.\n\nDivisibility rule for 11: subtract and add digits alternately and check if result is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 4422: (4 - 4 + 2 - 2) = 0, and 0 is divisible by 11, so 4422 is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, is 4422 the maximum possible arrangement? The digits are [4, 4, 2, 2]. The largest possible arrangement is 4422, which is indeed the maximum permutation. Since it satisfies divisibility",

As verified, 4422 is divisible by 11 (alternating sum: 4 \u2212 4 + 2 \u2212 2 = 0, and 0 mod 11 = 0). Since 4422 is the largest permutation and satisfies the divisibility condition, and the oracle confirms it as the maximum, the answer is confirmed.",
