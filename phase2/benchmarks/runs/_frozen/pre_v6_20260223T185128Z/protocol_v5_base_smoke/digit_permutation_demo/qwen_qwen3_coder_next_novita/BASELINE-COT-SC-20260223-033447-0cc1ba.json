    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the digits: [4, 2, 2, 4]  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using each digit **exactly once**, such that the number is divisible by **11**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Rule for divisibility by 11  \nA number is divisible by 11 **iff** the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11 (including 0).  \nThat is, for a 4-digit number with digits $a, b, c, d$ (from left to right), compute:  \n$$\n(a + c) - (b + d) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: All permutations of [4, 2, 2, 4]  \nWe have two 4s and two 2s. The total number of distinct permutations is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s list all distinct 4-digit numbers (in descending order to find the largest candidate that satisfies the condition):\n\n1. 4422  \n2. 4242  \n3. 4224  \n4. 2442  \n5. 2424  \n6. 2244  \n\nWe\u2019ll check each for divisibility by 11 using the alternating sum rule.\n\n#### 1. 4422  \nDigits: a=4, b=4, c=2, d=2  \n$(a + c) - (b + d) = (4 + 2) - (4 + 2) = 6 - 6 = 0$ \u2192 divisible by 11 \u2705\n\n#### 2. 4242  \n$(4 + 4) - (2 + 2) = 8 - 4 = 4$ \u2192 not divisible by 11 \u274c\n\n#### 3. 4224  \n$(4 + 2) - (2 + 4) = 6 - 6 = 0$ \u2192 divisible by 11 \u2705\n\n#### 4. 2442  \n$(2 + 4) - (4 + 2) = 6 - 6 = 0$ \u2192 divisible by 11 \u2705\n\n#### 5. 2424  \n$(2 +",
