    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the divisor (6) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [9, 1, 3, 8]. The oracle_max is given as 9318, which suggests that 9318 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if 9318 is indeed divisible by 6 and can be formed from the digits [9,1,3,8].\n\nFirst, check divisibility by 6: a number divisible by 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisible by 2: last digit must be even. 9318 ends in 8 \u2192 even \u2192 OK.\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9+3+1+8 = 21 \u2192 21 \u00f7 3 =",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Sum of digits = 9 + 3 + 1 + 8 = 21, which is divisible by 3. So 9318 is divisible by both 2 and 3 \u2192 divisible by 6. Now verify if 9318 can be formed using digits [9,1,3,8] \u2014 digits of 9318 are [9,3,1,8], which match exactly the given digits (order differs, but rearrangement is allowed). So 9318 is valid. Since the oracle_max is provided as 9318, and it satisfies all constraints, it is the maximum possible such number (as it's the largest permutation of those digits: 9831, 9813, 9381, 9318, ... \u2014 we can confirm 9318 is the largest divisible by",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Sum of digits = 9 + 3 + 1 + 8 = 21, divisible by 3. 9318 ends in 8 (even), so divisible by 2. Hence divisible by 6. Digits of 9318 are exactly [9,3,1,8], matching the input digits. To confirm it's the maximum, list descending permutations: 9831 (odd \u2192 not divisible by 2), 9813 (odd), 9381 (odd), 9318 (even). So 9318 is the largest valid permutation divisible by 6. Oracle_max = 9318 is correct.",
