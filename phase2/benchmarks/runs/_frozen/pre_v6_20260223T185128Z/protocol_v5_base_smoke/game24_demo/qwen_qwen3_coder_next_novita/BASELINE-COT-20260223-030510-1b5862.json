    "OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [6, 4, 10, 4], and we must use **each number exactly once** to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possible combinations.\n\nWe know common 24 game strategies involve multiplication (e.g., 6\u00d74 = 24), but we have extra numbers: 10 and another 4.\n\nLet\u2019s try to combine 10 and 4 to get something useful.\n\nTry:  \n- 10 - 4 = 6  \nThen we\u2019d have: 6, 6, 4 \u2192 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, but we\u2019d still have a 6 left \u2014 not helpful.\n\nTry:  \n- 10 + 4 = 14  \nThen 14 + 6 + 4 = 24 \u2192 14 + 6 + 4 = 24. Wait \u2014 that\u2019s 10 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 24. Yes! That uses all numbers exactly once.\n\nCheck:  \n10 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 24  \n\u2192 10 + 4 = 14  \n\u2192 14 + 6 = 20  \n\u2192 20 + 4 = 24 \u2705\n\nThat\u2019s valid \u2014 addition only, uses all numbers once.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the problem says \"use each number exactly once\", and doesn\u2019t restrict operations, so addition is fine.\n\nSo expression:  \n**10 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 24**\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check if parentheses or other operations are required \u2014 no, since it's just sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect multiplication? Let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a more \u201cstandard\u201d 24 solution.\n\nTry:  \n(10 - 6) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but we don\u2019t have 2.\n\nWe have two 4s \u2014 maybe (4 + 4) = 8, then 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, but we still have 10.\n\nWait: (10 - 6) = 4, then 4 \u00d7 4 + 4 = 20 \u2014 no.\n\nTry: (6 \u00d7 4) + (10 - 4) = 24 + 6 = 30 \u2014 too big.\n\n(6 + 4) + (10 +",
