    "SAMPLE 9 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers [3, 4, 4, 8] and need to use each **exactly once** to produce 24.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possible combinations.\n\nFirst, consider common 24 combinations:  \n- 6 \u00d7 4 = 24  \n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24  \n- 12 \u00d7 2 = 24  \n- 48 \u00f7 2 = 24  \n- (a + b) \u00d7 (c + d), etc.\n\nWe have 3, 4, 4, 8.\n\nTry using 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 that uses 8 and 3. Left with two 4s. If we can make them cancel (e.g., 4 \u2212 4 = 0), then 24 + 0 = 24. But need to use all numbers in a single expression.\n\nSo: (8 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u2212 4) = 24 + 0 = 24 \u2705  \nThat uses all numbers exactly once.\n\nCheck:  \n8 \u00d7 3 = 24  \n4 \u2212 4 = 0  \n24 + 0 = 24 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAlternative: (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but we don\u2019t have 2.  \nOr 4 \u00d7 (8 \u2212 3) \u2212 4 = 4 \u00d7 5 \u2212 4 = 20 \u2212 4 = 16 \u274c  \nOr (4 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 uses two 4s and 3, but not 8. Need to include 8.\n\nBut wait: (4 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 24, and we still need to use 8. So not valid unless we incorporate 8 neutrally.\n\nSame issue as before \u2014 need to use 8 in a way that doesn\u2019t change value.\n\nSo (8 \u00d7 3) + (4 \u2212 4) is valid.\n\nCan we do it without addition/subtraction of zero? Let's try multiplication/division.\n\nTry: 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 3/4)  \nCompute: 3/4 = 0.75, 4 \u2212 0.75 = 3.25, 8 \u00d7 3.25 = 26 \u274c\n\nTry",

    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [3, 4, 4, 8], and we must use each exactly once (and only once) with basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses allowed) to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possibilities.\n\nWe know 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, so if we can make the remaining two 4s cancel out (i.e., produce 1 or 0), we could do something like (8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24.\n\nCheck:  \n8 \u00d7 3 = 24  \n4 \u00f7 4 = 1  \n24 \u00d7 1 = 24 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThat uses all numbers: 8, 3, 4, 4 \u2014 each exactly once.\n\nSo the expression is:  \n(8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4)\n\nWe can simplify parentheses:  \n8 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4)  \nBut better to keep clear grouping.\n\nAlternative: (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but we don\u2019t have 2. So not valid.\n\nAnother idea: 4 \u00d7 (8 \u2212 4) + 3? That\u2019s 4\u00d74 + 3 = 19 \u2014 no.\n\n4 \u00d7 (3 + 4) \u2212 8 = 4\u00d77 \u2212 8 = 28 \u2212 8 = 20 \u2014 no.\n\n(4 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 but then 8 is unused. Need to use 8.\n\nSo the earlier idea with \u00d7(4\u00f74) is solid.\n\nThus, final expression:  \n(8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4)\n\nFINAL: (8*3)*(4/4)",
