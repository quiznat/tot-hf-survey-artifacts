    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop with input [1, 6, 9, 9] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer what is expected. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing a sum, product, or some expression. Given the numbers [1, 6, 9, 9], a plausible goal is to compute their sum. Let me try calculating the sum using the `calc` tool.\n\nACTION: calc 1 + 6 + 9 + 9",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 25",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of [1, 6, 9, 9] is 25, as computed. However, benchmark tasks with such inputs often involve more specific operations\u2014e.g., forming the largest possible number by concatenation, computing a product, or evaluating an expression like 1 + 6 \u00d7 9 + 9 (which would be 64 due to order of operations). Since the task is ambiguous, I should consider common patterns. Another possibility is to compute the result of combining the numbers with standard arithmetic to reach a target (e.g., 24 game), but 25 is already a clean result. Given the minimal context and that the sum is straightforward and matches the calculation, I\u2019ll conclude the task is to compute the sum.\n\nFINAL: 25"
