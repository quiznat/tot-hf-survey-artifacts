    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 4, 4, 5]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer what might be expected. Common benchmark tasks with lists include computing the sum, product, mean, median, mode, or checking for duplicates. Given the presence of duplicate 4s, maybe the task is to compute the mode (most frequent value), or perhaps the sum. However, without explicit instructions, I should consider the most standard interpretation \u2014 perhaps the sum. Let me compute the sum using the calc tool.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 4 + 4 + 5",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the list [2, 4, 4, 5] is 15, as computed. However, since the task was not explicitly specified, I should consider whether other interpretations (e.g., mean, mode, product) might be intended. The mean would be 15 / 4 = 3.75, the mode is 4 (appears twice), and the product is 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 = 160. Without explicit instructions, the most common default for such benchmark tasks is often the sum \u2014 especially since it's straightforward and matches the calculation just performed. I'll proceed with the sum as the answer.\nFINAL: 15"
