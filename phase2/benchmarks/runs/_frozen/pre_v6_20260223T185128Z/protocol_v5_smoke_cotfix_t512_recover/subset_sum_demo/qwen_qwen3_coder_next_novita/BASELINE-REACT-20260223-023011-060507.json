    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the given numbers [1, 4, 8, 9, 9, 10, 16, 21] that sums to the target 30. I need to use the available tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a list sums to the target. Let me start by trying some combinations. First, I'll try the largest numbers to see if they get close to 30. For example, 21 + 9 = 30 \u2014 but there are two 9s, so 21 + 9 = 30 is possible. Let me verify using `check_target` with [21, 9]. But I need to be careful: which 9? Since there are two 9s, and both are in the list, [21, 9] is a valid subset. Let me try that.\nACTION: check_target [21, 9]",
