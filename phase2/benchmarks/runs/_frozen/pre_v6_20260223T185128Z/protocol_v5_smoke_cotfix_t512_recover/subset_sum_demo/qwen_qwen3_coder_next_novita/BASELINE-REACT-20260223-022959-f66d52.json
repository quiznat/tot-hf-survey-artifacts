    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the given numbers [2, 10, 10, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25] that sums to the target 50. I need to use the available tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a list sums to the target. Let me start by trying some combinations. First, I'll try the largest numbers to see if they get close to 50. Let's try [25, 24, 2] = 51 \u2014 too high. [25, 22] = 47 \u2014 close, need 3 more, but no 3. [25, 19, 2] = 46 \u2014 need 4 more, no 4. [25, 18, 10] = 53 \u2014 too high. [25, 10, 10, 2] = 47 \u2014 need 3 more. [24, 22, 2] = 48 \u2014 need 2 more, and we have another 2? Wait, only one 2. [24, 19, 10] = 53 \u2014 too high. [24, 18, 10] = 52 \u2014 too high. [22, 19, 10] = 51 \u2014 too high. [22, 18, 10] = 50 \u2014 yes! Let's verify: 22 + 18 = 40, +10 = 50. We have two 10s, so that's fine. So [22, 18, 10] sums to 50. Let me use `sum_list` to confirm.\nACTION: sum_list [22, 18, 10]",
