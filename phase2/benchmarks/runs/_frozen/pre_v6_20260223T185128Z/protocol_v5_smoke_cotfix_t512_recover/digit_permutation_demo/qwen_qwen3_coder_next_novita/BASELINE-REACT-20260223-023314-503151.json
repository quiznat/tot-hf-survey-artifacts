    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 3, 3, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is given as 3336, which suggests that 3336 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible number formed from those digits divisible by 8). Let's verify.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nDigits available: 6, 3, 3, 3 \u2192 possible permutations (unique due to repeated 3s):\n- 6333\n- 3633\n- 3363\n- 3336\n\nNow check each for divisibility by 8:\n\n1. 6333 \u2192 last three digits = 333 \u2192 333 \u00f7 8 = 41.625 \u2192 not divisible.\n2. 3633 \u2192 last three digits = 633 \u2192 633 \u00f7 8 = 79.125 \u2192 not divisible.\n3. 3363 \u2192 last three digits = 363 \u2192 363 \u00f7 8 = 45.375 \u2192 not divisible.\n4. 3336 \u2192 last three digits = 336 \u2192 336 \u00f7 8 = 42 \u2192 divisible.\n\nSo 3336 is divisible by 8, and it's the largest among the permutations (since digits sorted descending is 6,3,3,3 \u2192 6333 is largest, but not divisible; next is 3633, etc., and 3336 is the first divisible one when going descending). Since oracle_max = 3336, and it's valid, the answer is 3336.\n\nBut to follow the ReAct loop, I should use the tools if needed. Let's see: we can use `is_divisible` to verify 3336 % 8 == 0, or `best_divisible` to directly get the answer.\n\nGiven that `best_divisible` likely returns the largest number formed by the digits divisible by the divisor, and oracle_max matches 3336, using `best_divisible"
