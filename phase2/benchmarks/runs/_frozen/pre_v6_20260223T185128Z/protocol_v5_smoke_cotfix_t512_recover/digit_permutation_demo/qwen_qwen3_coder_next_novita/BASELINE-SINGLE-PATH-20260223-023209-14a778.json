    "OUTPUT: We are given digits: **[1, 9, 0, 8]**  \nWe must form the **largest possible 4-digit integer** using each digit **exactly once**, and the number must be **divisible by 6**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility by 6  \nA number is divisible by 6 **iff** it is divisible by both **2** and **3**.\n\n- **Divisible by 2** \u2192 last digit must be even: possible even digits from the set: **0, 8**\n- **Divisible by 3** \u2192 sum of digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nSum of digits:  \n1 + 9 + 0 + 8 = **18**, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 \u2705 So **any** arrangement of these digits will be divisible by 3.\n\nSo we only need to ensure the number ends in an even digit (**0 or 8**) and is as large as possible.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the largest possible 4-digit number ending in 0 or 8\n\nWe want the **largest** number, so we want the **largest possible digits in the higher places**.\n\nLet\u2019s try ending with **8** first (since 8 > 0, and ending with 8 may give a larger number than ending with 0).\n\nDigits left: [1, 9, 0] \u2192 arrange them in descending order: **9, 1, 0**\n\nSo candidate: **9108**\n\nNow try ending with **0**:\n\nDigits left: [1, 9, 8] \u2192 descending: **9, 8, 1**\n\nCandidate: **9810**\n\nCompare:\n- 9810 vs 9108 \u2192 **9810 is larger**\n\nCheck if 9810 is divisible by 6:\n- Ends in 0 \u2192 divisible by 2 \u2705\n- Sum = 9+8+1+0 = 18 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2705  \n\u2192 So divisible by 6 \u2705\n\n\u2705 Valid.\n\nIs there any larger arrangement ending in 0?  \nWe used the largest possible digits in descending order: 9, 8, 1, 0 \u2192 that's the largest possible number ending in 0.\n\nWhat about ending in 8 but with a larger prefix?  \nWe tried 9108.
