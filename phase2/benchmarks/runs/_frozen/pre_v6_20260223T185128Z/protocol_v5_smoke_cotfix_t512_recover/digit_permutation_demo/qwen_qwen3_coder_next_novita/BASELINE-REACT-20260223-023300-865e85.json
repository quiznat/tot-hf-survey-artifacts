    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [1, 9, 0, 8] that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9810. Let's verify if 9810 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2: last digit is 0 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits = 9 + 8 + 1 + 0 = 18 \u2192 18 is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 9810 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says 9810 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9810. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools. Let's use `is_divisible` to verify 9810 % 6 == 0.  \nAlternatively, `best_divisible` might directly give the answer. Since the oracle_max is given, and it's likely the correct answer, but let's verify with `is_divisible` first.  \nI'll call `is_divisible` with 9810 and divisor 6.  \nBut wait \u2014 the tools likely expect the digits as input, not the number. Let me check tool signatures:  \n- `best_divisible(digits, divisor)` \u2192 returns the largest number formed by permuting digits divisible by divisor.  \n- `is_divisible(number, divisor)` \u2192 returns True/False.  \nSo for `is_divisible`, I need to pass the number (9810) and divisor (6).  \nBut the task input gives digits [1,9,0,8], so maybe `best_divisible` is the direct tool to use. Since oracle_max is 9810, and it's a permutation of the digits, and likely correct, but to be safe, I should call `best_divisible([1,9,0,8], 6)` to get the answer.  \nHowever, in ReAct, we should use tools to verify. Let's first try `is_divisible(9810, 6)`.  \nBut wait \u2014 do I know 9810 is the candidate? Yes, because oracle_max is given as 9810,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 9810, which is a permutation of [1,9,0,8]. To confirm it's the correct answer, I need to verify it's divisible by 6. Since 9810 ends in 0 (even), it's divisible by 2. Sum of digits = 9+8+1+0 = 18, divisible by 3, so divisible by 6. But to follow ReAct protocol and use tools, I should call `is_divisible(9810, 6)` to verify. Alternatively, `best_divisible([1,9,0,8], 6)` would directly return the answer. Since the task is to find the largest such number, and the oracle suggests 9810, using `best_divisible` is more efficient and appropriate. I'll call `best_divisible` with the given digits and divisor.\nACTION: best_divisible [1, 9, 0, 8] 6",
