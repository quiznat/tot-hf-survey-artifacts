    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [2, 5, 7, 6] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum is 7652. Let's verify if 7652 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 7652, the last two digits are 52. 52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so 52 is divisible by 4, meaning 7652 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says 7652 is the maximum, and it's valid, we can confirm it. But to follow the ReAct loop, I should use the tools to verify or find it. Let's use `is_divisible` to check 7652 first. If it's divisible, and it's the oracle_max, then it's the answer. Alternatively, `best_divisible` might directly give the answer. Since `best_divisible` is likely designed to find the largest divisible number from the digits, I should try that first.\nACTION: best_divisible [2, 5, 7, 6] 4",
