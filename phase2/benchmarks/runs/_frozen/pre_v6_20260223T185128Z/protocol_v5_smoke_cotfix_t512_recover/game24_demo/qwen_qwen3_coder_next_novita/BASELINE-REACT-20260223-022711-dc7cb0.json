    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [1, 10, 7, 6]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer what might be expected. Common benchmark tasks with lists of numbers include computing the sum, product, average, or sorting. Given the presence of the `calc` tool, it's likely a calculation is required. Let me consider the sum: 1 + 10 + 7 + 6 = 24. I'll use the `calc` tool to compute this to be safe. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the result of some expression \u2014 but without more context, sum is a reasonable first guess. Let me compute the sum using `calc`.\nACTION: calc 1 + 10 + 7 + 6",
