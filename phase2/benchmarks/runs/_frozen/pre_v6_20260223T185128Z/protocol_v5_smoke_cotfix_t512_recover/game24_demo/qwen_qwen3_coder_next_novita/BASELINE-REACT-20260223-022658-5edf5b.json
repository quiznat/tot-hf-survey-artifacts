    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is a list of numbers: [4, 10, 7, 3]. However, the task description doesn\u2019t specify what operation to perform. Common benchmark tasks with lists of numbers include computing the sum, product, average, or perhaps sorting or finding max/min. Since no specific instruction is given, I should consider the most likely interpretation: perhaps compute the sum, as it's the simplest and most common operation in such tasks.\n\nLet me compute the sum: 4 + 10 + 7 + 3 = 24.\n\nBut before finalizing, I should verify if the calc tool can help \u2014 maybe it expects a specific expression. The calc tool likely evaluates arithmetic expressions. So I can use calc to compute the sum.\n\nACTION: calc 4 + 10 + 7 + 3",
