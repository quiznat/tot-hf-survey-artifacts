    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [1, 4, 1, 6]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer what is expected. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing the sum, product, average, or applying some operation. Given the available tool is `calc`, which likely evaluates arithmetic expressions, I should consider what expression to compute. A reasonable default is to compute the sum of the numbers. Let me compute 1 + 4 + 1 + 6 = 12. I'll use the `calc` tool to verify.\nACTION: calc 1 + 4 + 1 + 6",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The calculation returned 12, which matches my expected sum of the numbers [1, 4, 1, 6]. Since the task was ambiguous but the sum is a natural interpretation and the result is consistent, I can now conclude the answer.\nFINAL: 12"
