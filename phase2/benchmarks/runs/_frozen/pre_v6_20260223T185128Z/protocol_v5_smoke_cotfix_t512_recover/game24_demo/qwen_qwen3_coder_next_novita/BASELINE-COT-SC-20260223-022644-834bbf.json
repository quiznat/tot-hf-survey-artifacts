    "SAMPLE 1 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [6, 4, 10, 4], and we must use each exactly once (and only once) with standard arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses allowed) to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possibilities.\n\nFirst, note that 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, so if we can make the other two numbers (10 and 4) cancel out or become 1 (so multiplying by 1 doesn\u2019t change), or combine to 0 (add/subtract), etc.\n\nTry:  \n(10 \u2212 4) = 6, then 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 \u2014 but we still have a 6 left. Wait, we used 10 and 4 to make 6, and we have original 6 and another 4. So that gives us 6, 6, 4 \u2014 not helpful directly.\n\nTry:  \n(6 + 4) = 10, then 10 + 10 + 4 = 24 \u2014 but that uses two 10s (we only have one 10), and we\u2019d be using 6, 4, 10, 4 \u2192 yes: (6 + 4) = 10, then 10 + 10 + 4 = 24 \u2014 but that\u2019s three numbers used to make first 10, then adding original 10 and remaining 4 \u2192 that\u2019s all four numbers: 6, 4, 10, 4. So expression: (6 + 4) + 10 + 4 = 24. That\u2019s 10 + 10 + 4 = 24. Yes!

Yes, addition is commutative, and we\u2019re using each number once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect multiplication/division, but this is valid.\n\nLet\u2019s verify: 6 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24 \u2192 24 =",
