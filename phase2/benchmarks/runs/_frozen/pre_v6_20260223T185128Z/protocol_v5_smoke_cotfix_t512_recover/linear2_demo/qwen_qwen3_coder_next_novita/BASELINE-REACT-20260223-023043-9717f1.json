    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [a, b, c] representing equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 5x + 1y = 45\nEquation 2: -9x + (-7)y = -107 \u2192 -9x - 7y = -107\n\nWe need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a system of two linear equations given their coefficients.\n\nLet me prepare the input for `solve2`. Since each equation is given as [a, b, c], and we have two equations, the input should be the list of equations: [[5, 1, 45], [-9, -7, -107]] \u2014 which matches the input format.\n\nI'll use `solve2` directly.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[5, 1, 45], [-9, -7, -107]]",
