    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a system of two linear equations in two variables (likely x and y), represented as coefficients. Each inner list has three elements: [a, b, c] corresponding to the equation a*x + b*y = c.\n\nThe equations are:\n1. -7x + 8y = -25\n2. -7x - 7y = -70\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let's analyze.\n\nWe can subtract the two equations to eliminate x:\nEquation 1: -7x + 8y = -25  \nEquation 2: -7x - 7y = -70  \nSubtract Eq2 from Eq1:  \n(-7x + 8y) - (-7x - 7y) = -25 - (-70)  \n\u2192 -7x + 8y + 7x + 7y = -25 + 70  \n\u2192 15y = 45  \n\u2192 y = 3\n\nNow plug y = 3 into one equation to find x. Use Eq2:  \n-7x - 7(3) = -70  \n\u2192 -7x - 21 = -70  \n\u2192 -7x = -49  \n\u2192 x = 7\n\nSo solution is x = 7, y = 3.\n\nWe can verify with Eq1: -7(7) + 8(3) = -49 + 24 = -25 \u2713\n\nNow, which tool to use? We have `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since we already solved manually, but to be formal and ensure correctness, we could call `solve2` with the equations.\n\nAssuming `solve2` takes the list of equations as input, e.g., `solve2([[-7, 8, -25], [-7, -7, -70]])`.\n\nAlternatively, `check_xy` likely takes x, y, and equations to verify \u2014 but we want to solve, not verify.\n\nSo best to use `solve2`.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-7, 8, -25], [-7, -7, -70]]",
