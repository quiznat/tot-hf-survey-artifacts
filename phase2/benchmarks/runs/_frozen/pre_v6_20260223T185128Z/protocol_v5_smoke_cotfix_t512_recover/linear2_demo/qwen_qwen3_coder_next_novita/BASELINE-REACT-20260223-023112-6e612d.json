    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in two variables (likely x and y), represented as coefficient matrices with constants. Each inner list has three elements: [a, b, c] corresponding to the equation a*x + b*y = c.\n\nSo the equations are:\n1) 7x - 9y = -72  \n2) -9x + 0y = 81 \u2192 -9x = 81 \u2192 x = -9\n\nFrom equation 2, we can directly solve for x: x = -9.\n\nThen substitute into equation 1 to find y:\n7*(-9) - 9y = -72  \n\u2192 -63 - 9y = -72  \n\u2192 -9y = -72 + 63 = -9  \n\u2192 y = 1\n\nSo solution is x = -9, y = 1.\n\nWe can verify using check_xy tool.\n\nAlternatively, use solve2 tool if it's designed for solving 2x2 systems.\n\nLet\u2019s try solve2 first \u2014 it likely takes the coefficient matrix and constant vector.\n\nInput format for solve2? Possibly: solve2([[7, -9], [-9, 0]], [-72, 81]) or maybe just the augmented form as given.\n\nBut the tool input may expect the equations in the same format as the input: i.e., list of equations.\n\nLet\u2019s assume solve2 expects the list of equations as given: [[7, -9, -72], [-9, 0, 81]].\n\nSo ACTION: solve2 [[7, -9, -72], [-9, 0, 81]]",
