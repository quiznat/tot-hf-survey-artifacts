    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -6x - 7y = -6  \nEquation 2: -8x + y = -8  \n\nWe need to solve this system of two linear equations in two variables (x, y). The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a 2\u00d72 system directly, and the input format matches two equations, I should use `solve2` with the given equations.\n\nLet me format the input for `solve2`. It probably expects the coefficients as a list of equations, each equation being [a, b, c] for ax + by = c \u2014 exactly as provided.\n\nSo I'll call: solve2 [[-6, -7, -6], [-8, 1, -8]]\n\nBut wait \u2014 the tool name is `solve2`, and the input should be passed as a single argument. In the format used in ReAct, it's likely `solve2 [[-6, -7, -6], [-8, 1, -8]]`.\n\nLet me proceed with that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-6, -7, -6], [-8, 1, -8]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x = 1.000000 and y = -0.000000 (which is effectively y = 0). Let me verify this solution by plugging into the original equations:\n\nEquation 1: -6x - 7y = -6  \n\u2192 -6(1) - 7(0) = -6 - 0 = -6 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEquation 2: -8x + y = -8  \n\u2192 -8(1) + 0 = -8 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThe solution satisfies both equations. So the solution is x = 1, y = 0.\n\nSince the task is solved and verified, I can now output the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=1,y=0"
