    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [a, b, c] representing equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -8x - 9y = -82  \nEquation 2: 7x - 7y = 42  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which is likely designed to solve a system of two linear equations. Let me pass the equations to `solve2`.\n\nThe input format for `solve2` is likely the list of equations, i.e., [[-8, -9, -82], [7, -7, 42]].\n\nAlternatively, I could use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions, but since I don\u2019t yet have a candidate, `solve2` is more appropriate first.\n\nLet me call `solve2` with the equations.\n\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-8, -9, -82], [7, -7, 42]]",
