So we have:\n1) 1x - 3y = 0\n2) 1x + 7y = -30\n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can use the solve2 tool, which is presumably designed for solving systems of two linear equations. Let me try that first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[1, -3, 0], [1, 7, -30]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solve2 tool returned x = -9.0 and y = -3.0 as the solution to the system of equations. To verify correctness, I should use the check_xy tool to confirm that these values satisfy both original equations:  \n1) x - 3y = 0 \u2192 -9 - 3(-3) = -9 + 9 = 0 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) x + 7y = -30 \u2192 -9 + 7(-3) = -9 - 21 = -30 \u2714\ufe0f  \nVerification is straightforward, so I'll call check_xy with x = -9 and y = -3.\n\nACTION: check_xy -9 -3\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: Both equations satisfied.\nFINAL: x=-9,y=-3"
