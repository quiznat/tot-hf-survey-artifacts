    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n-7x - 4y = -31\n-2x - 2y = -14\n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic methods or use the available tools. Let's consider using solve2, which likely solves a 2x2 system. The input format for solve2 is probably the coefficients matrix and constants vector. Given the equations, the coefficient matrix is [[-7, -4], [-2, -2]] and constants are [-31, -14]. So I should call solve2 with these.\n\nAlternatively, check_xy might verify a candidate solution, but I don\u2019t yet have a candidate. So better to use solve2 directly.\n\nLet me call solve2 with the system: coefficients [[-7, -4], [-2, -2]] and constants [-31, -14].\n\nBut wait \u2014 the tool might expect input in a specific format. Since the input was given as list of [a, b, c] per equation, maybe solve2 expects a list of equations in that format. Let me assume solve2 takes the list of equations as given: [[-7, -4, -31], [-2, -2, -14]].\n\nI'll try ACTION: solve2 [[-7, -4, -31], [-2, -2, -14]]\n\nBut need to be careful: tool inputs must be valid JSON or structured. Since the format is not specified, I'll use the same structure as the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe solve2 expects just the coefficient matrix and RHS separately. But given the input format, it's safer to pass the same structure.\n\nLet me proceed with solve2 using the list of equations.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe I should solve manually to verify.\n\nEquation 1: -7x - 4y = -31  \nEquation 2: -2x - 2y = -14 \u2192 divide by -2: x + y = 7 \u2192 y = 7 - x\n\nSubstitute into Eq1:  \n-7x - 4(7 - x) = -31  \n-7x -28 + 4x = -31  \n-3x -28 = -31  \n-3x = -3 \u2192",
