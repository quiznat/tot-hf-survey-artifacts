    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form of augmented matrices: [[-2, -3, -10], [1, 4, 20]], which corresponds to:\n- Equation 1: -2x - 3y = -10\n- Equation 2: 1x + 4y = 20\n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which is likely designed for solving 2-variable linear systems. Alternatively, I could use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions, but since I don\u2019t yet have a candidate, `solve2` is more appropriate first.\n\nLet me call `solve2` with the equations. The input format for `solve2` is likely the list of equations as given \u2014 i.e., the augmented matrix rows.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-2, -3, -10], [1, 4, 20]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x = -4.0 and y = 6.0 as the solution to the system. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool with the original equations. Plugging x = -4 and y = 6 into both equations:\n\nEquation 1: -2(-4) - 3(6) = 8 - 18 = -10 \u2714\ufe0f  \nEquation 2: 1(-4) + 4(6) = -4 + 24 = 20 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nBoth equations are satisfied. I will now use `check_xy` to confirm.\n\nACTION: check_xy -4 6\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: Both equations satisfied.\nFINAL: x=-4,y=6"
