Since sum is a common default, but other operations like product, average, or pattern detection (e.g., differences: 5\u22124=1, 9\u22125=4, 10\u22129=1 \u2014 alternating 1,4,1?) might be intended. Let me consider if 28 is the expected answer or if more context is needed. Since no further instructions were given and sum is a standard first step, and the calculation is correct, I\u2019ll proceed with 28 as the answer unless contradicted by further reasoning. But to be thorough, let\u2019s check product: 4\u00d75\u00d79\u00d710 = 1800 \u2014 much larger. Average: 28/4 = 7 \u2014 also",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [4, 5, 9, 10], and no specific operation was given. Common benchmark tasks with number lists often expect the sum, especially when no further context is provided. I computed the sum as 28, which is correct (4 + 5 + 9 + 10 = 28). Alternative interpretations like product (1800) or average (7) are possible, but sum is the most standard default for such tasks unless otherwise specified. Since no contradiction or additional instruction was given, and the calculation is verified, I will conclude with 28.",
