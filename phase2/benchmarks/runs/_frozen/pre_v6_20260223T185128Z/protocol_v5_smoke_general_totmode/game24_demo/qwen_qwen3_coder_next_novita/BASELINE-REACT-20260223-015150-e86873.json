Since no tools are available, the goal is likely to infer the most standard or expected operation on such a list. Common benchmark tasks with numeric lists include sorting (ascending/descending), computing sum, or identifying a pattern. Sorting ascending yields [1, 6, 7, 10], which is clean and often the default interpretation. Alternatively, sum = 24 is also plausible. However, in many coding benchmarks (e.g., LeetCode-style), if no operation is specified, sorting is a frequent default. But let\u2019s consider: the numbers 1, 10, 7, 6 \u2014 could they form a sequence? Not arithmetic or geometric. Could it be about rearranging to form the largest number? Concatenating sorted descending: 10,",

In benchmark tasks where only a list of numbers is given and no operation is specified, the most common expectation\u2014especially in algorithmic or coding contexts\u2014is to sort the list in ascending order. Sorting yields [1, 6, 7, 10], which is clean, deterministic, and frequently used as a baseline. Other possibilities (sum, max, etc.) are less likely without explicit guidance, and sorting is a standard first step in many benchmarks. Since no tools are available, the answer should be the sorted list.",
