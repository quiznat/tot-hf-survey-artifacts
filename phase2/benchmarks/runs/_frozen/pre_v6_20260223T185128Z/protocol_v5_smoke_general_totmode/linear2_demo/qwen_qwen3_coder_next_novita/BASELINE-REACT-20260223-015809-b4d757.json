    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents the linear equation ax + by = c. We have two equations:\n1. -8x - 9y = -82  \n2. 7x - 7y = 42  \n\nWe need to solve this system of equations for x and y. Let's solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify the second equation:  \n7x - 7y = 42 \u2192 divide both sides by 7: x - y = 6 \u2192 so x = y + 6.\n\nNow substitute x = y + 6 into the first equation:  \n-8(y + 6) - 9y = -82  \n\u2192 -8y - 48 - 9y = -82  \n\u2192 -17y - 48 = -82  \n\u2192 -1",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Continuing the solution:  \n-17y - 48 = -82  \nAdd 48 to both sides: -17y = -34  \nDivide by -17: y = 2  \n\nNow substitute y = 2 into x = y + 6:  \nx = 2 + 6 = 8  \n\nSo the solution is x = 8, y = 2. Let's verify:  \nFirst equation: -8(8) - 9(2) = -64 - 18 = -82 \u2714\ufe0f  \nSecond equation: 7(8) - 7(2) = 56 - 14 = 42 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nThe solution is correct.  \nFINAL: x=8, y=2"
