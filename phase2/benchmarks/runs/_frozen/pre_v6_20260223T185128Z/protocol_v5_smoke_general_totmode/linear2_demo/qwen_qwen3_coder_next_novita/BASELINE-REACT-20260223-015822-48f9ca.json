    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. We have two equations:  \n1) 8x + 8y = -16  \n2) -5x + 8y = 62  \n\nWe need to solve this system for x and y. Let's solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify equation 1: divide both sides by 8 \u2192 x + y = -2 \u2192 so y = -2 - x.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:  \n-5x + 8(-2 - x) = 62  \n\u2192 -5x -16 -8x = 62  \n\u2192 -13x -16 = 62  \n\u2192 -13x = 78  \n\u2192 x = -6\n\nThen y = -2",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's verify the solution. From equation 1: 8x + 8y = 8*(-6) + 8*(-2) = -48 -16 = -64, but the RHS is -16. That's inconsistent \u2014 I made a mistake in simplification.\n\nWait: Equation 1 is 8x + 8y = -16. Dividing by 8 gives x + y = -2 \u2014 that part is correct. Then y = -2 - x.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: -5x + 8y = 62  \n\u2192 -5x + 8(-2 - x) = 62  \n\u2192 -5x -16 -8x = 62  \n\u2192 -13x = 78  \n\u2192 x = -6  \nThen y = -2 - (-6) = 4.\n\nAh! I",
