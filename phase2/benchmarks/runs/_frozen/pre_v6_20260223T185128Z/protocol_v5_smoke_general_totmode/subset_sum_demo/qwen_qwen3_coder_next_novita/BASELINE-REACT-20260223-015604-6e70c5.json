    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a way to reach the target number 21 using the given list of numbers [8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 25]. Since no tools are available, this is likely a puzzle where we need to combine numbers using arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) \u2014 possibly using each number at most once \u2014 to get 21.\n\nLet\u2019s examine possible combinations:\n\n- Try simple addition:  \n  8 + 11 = 19 \u2192 need +2 (not available)  \n  8 + 12 = 20 \u2192 need +1  \n  8 + 13 = 21 \u2192 **YES!** 8 + 13 = 21.\n\nCheck: 8 and 13 are both in the list.
