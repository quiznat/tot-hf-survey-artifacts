From earlier reasoning, I found that 22 + 18 + 10 = 50, and all these numbers are present in the list (we have two 10s, so using one is valid). This is a valid solution. The final answer should be the subset or the sum expression \u2014 but since the task is a benchmark subset-sum task, typically the expected output is the subset (or just confirmation). However, the instruction says \"FINAL: <answer>\", and in many such tasks, the answer is the subset listed. Let's present it clearly.\n\nFINAL: [22, 18, 10]"
