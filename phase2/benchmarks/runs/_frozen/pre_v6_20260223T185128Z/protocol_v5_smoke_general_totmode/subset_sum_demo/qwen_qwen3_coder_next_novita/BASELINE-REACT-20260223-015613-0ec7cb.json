    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We are given a list of numbers: [2, 6, 14, 18, 22, 24] and a target: 62. We need to find a combination (likely using arithmetic operations) to reach 62. Since no tools are available, this is a pure reasoning puzzle \u2014 possibly using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, concatenation, or exponentiation, but typically in such benchmarks, basic arithmetic and possibly parentheses are allowed.\n\nLet\u2019s explore sums first:\n- Sum of all numbers: 2 + 6 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 24 = 86 \u2192 too high.\n- Try subsets:\n  - 24 + 22 = 46; 62 - 46 = 16 \u2192 do we have 16? No, but 14 + 2 =",

Alternatively, try combinations of 3 or 4 numbers.\n\nCheck:\n- 24 + 22 + 18 = 64 \u2192 too high by 2 \u2192 64 - 2 = 62! That works: 24 + 22 + 18 - 2 = 62. All numbers used are in the list: 24, 22, 18, 2 \u2014 yes. Remaining numbers (6, 14) not used, but the task likely allows using a subset.\n\nDouble-check: 24 + 22 = 46; 46 + 18 = 64; 64 -",
