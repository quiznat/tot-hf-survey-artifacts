    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [2, 5, 7, 6]. The oracle_max is given as 7652, which is likely the maximum possible number (not necessarily divisible by 4), but we need the maximum *divisible by 4*.\n\nRecall: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nWe have digits: [2, 5, 7, 6]. All permutations of these digits (4! = 24) are manageable manually.\n\nFirst, sort digits descending: [7, 6, 5, 2] \u2192 7652 (oracle_max). Check if 7652 divisible by 4: last two digits = 52. 52 \u00f7 4",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (4) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [2, 5, 7, 6]. The oracle_max is 7652, which is the largest possible number from these digits, but may not be divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. Let\u2019s check 7652: last two digits are 52, and 52 \u00f7 4 = 13 \u2192 divisible. So 7652 is divisible by 4. Since it's the largest possible permutation and satisfies the divisibility condition, it must be the answer.",
