    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the given divisor (6) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [1, 9, 0, 8]. The oracle_max is given as 9810, which suggests that 9810 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation of those digits divisible by 6). Let's verify:\n\nDigits: [1, 9, 0, 8] \u2192 possible permutations. The largest permutation is 9810.\n\nCheck divisibility by 6: A number divisible by 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisible by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 0 is even \u2192 OK.\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits = 1 + 9 + 0 + 8 = 18, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 OK.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 6 that can be formed by rearranging the digits [1, 9, 0, 8]. The oracle_max is given as 9810. We verified that 9810 is divisible by 6: it ends in 0 (even, so divisible by 2), and digit sum is 1+9+0+8=18, divisible by 3. Since 9810 is the largest possible permutation of these digits (9810 > 9801, 9180, etc.) and satisfies divisibility by 6, it must be the answer. No further computation or tools are needed.\nFINAL: 9810"
