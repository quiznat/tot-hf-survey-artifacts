    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [6, 3, 3, 3] that is divisible by 8, and the oracle_max is given as 3336. Let's verify if 3336 is valid: digits of 3336 are [3, 3, 3, 6] \u2014 matches the multiset [6, 3, 3, 3]. Now check divisibility by 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 3336, last three digits are 336. 336 \u00f7 8 = 42 \u2192 exact, so 3336 is divisible by 8. Is there a larger number possible? The digits sorted descending: 6,3,3,3 \u2192 largest",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The digits [6, 3, 3, 3] can form numbers up to 6333 as the largest permutation. But the oracle_max is 3336, which is less than 6333, so perhaps 3336 is the *maximum divisible by 8*, not the maximum overall. Let's check all permutations of [6,3,3,3] in descending order and test divisibility by 8.\n\nPermutations in descending order:\n- 6333 \u2192 last three digits = 333 \u2192 333 \u00f7 8 = 41.625 \u2192 not divisible\n- 3633 \u2192 last three = 633 \u2192 633 \u00f7 8 = 79.125 \u2192 no\n- 3363 \u2192 last three = 363 \u2192",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Continue checking permutations in descending order. We already saw 6333 and 3633 are not divisible by 8. Next: 3363 \u2192 last three digits = 363; 363 \u00f7 8 = 45.375 \u2192 not divisible. Next: 3336 \u2192 last three = 336; 336 \u00f7 8 = 42 \u2192 divisible. So 3336 is the first (i.e., largest) permutation divisible by 8. Since oracle_max = 3336 matches this, and no larger permutation works, the answer is 3336.",
