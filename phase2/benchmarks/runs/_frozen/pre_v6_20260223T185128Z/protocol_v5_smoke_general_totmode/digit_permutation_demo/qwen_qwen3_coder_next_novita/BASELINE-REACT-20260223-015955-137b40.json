    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by the divisor (6) that can be formed by rearranging the given digits [9, 1, 3, 8]. The oracle_max is given as 9318, which suggests that 9318 is the correct answer \u2014 but I need to verify if 9318 is indeed divisible by 6 and is the maximum possible such number.\n\nFirst, recall: A number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits from [9,1,3,8] are only 8 (since 8 is even).\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 21, which is divisible by",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 21, which is divisible by 3. For divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even \u2014 only 8 is even among the digits. So any valid number divisible by 6 must end in 8. To maximize the number, we want the largest possible prefix before the final 8. The remaining digits are [9, 1, 3]. The largest arrangement of these is 931, so the largest candidate is 9318. Check: 9318 \u00f7 6 = 1553, which is an integer. So 9318 is valid and is indeed the maximum possible. The oracle_max matches this. No further action needed.",
