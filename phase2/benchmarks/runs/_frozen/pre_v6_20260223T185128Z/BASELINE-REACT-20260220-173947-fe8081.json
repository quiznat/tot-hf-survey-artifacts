    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [2, 2, 4, 9] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to combine the numbers [2, 2, 4, 9] using arithmetic operations to reach a target (e.g., 24 game). However, no target is given. Alternatively, maybe the task is to compute something like sum, product, or find an expression.\n\nGiven the numbers [2, 2, 4, 9], common operations:\n- Sum: 2 + 2 + 4 + 9 = 17\n- Product: 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 9 = 144\n- Maybe target is 24? Let's test: 9 - 2 = 7; 7 - 2",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is ambiguous, but given the numbers [2, 2, 4, 9] and the presence of a `calc` tool, this resembles the classic \"24 game\" where the goal is to combine numbers with arithmetic operations to reach 24. Let\u2019s test if 24 is achievable:  \n- Try (9 - 2) \u00d7 (4 - 2) = 7 \u00d7 2 = 14 \u2192 no  \n- Try 9 \u00d7 2 + 4 + 2 = 18 + 6 = 24 \u2192 yes!  \nSo expression: 9 * 2 + 4 + 2 = 24. I should verify with `calc`.  \nACTION: calc 9 * 2 + 4 + 2",
