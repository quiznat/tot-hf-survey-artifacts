    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task using the available tools. The task input is [1, 1, 5, 5] and I have access to a calc tool. Since there's no specific instruction on what to do with these numbers, I should first explore what operations might be meaningful. Let me try some basic calculations to see if I can find a pattern or solution.\n\nACTION: calc 1+1+5+5\n\nScratchpad:",

Let me try other operations to see if there's a more meaningful pattern or if I need to interpret the task differently. Perhaps I should look at multiplication or other combinations.\n\nACTION: calc 1*1*5*5\n\nScratchpad:\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: 25",

Let me reconsider what the task might be asking for. Since we have four numbers that form pairs (1,1) and (5,5), maybe I should consider operations that work with these pairs specifically. Let me try calculating 1+5 and 1+5 separately, or perhaps 5-1 and 5-1.\n\nACTION: calc 5-1\n\nScratchpad:\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: 4\nSTEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I calculated 5-1 = 4.
