However, this needs confirmation.\n\nFINAL: The sum of the numbers [2, 2, 4, 9] is 17. Please specify if you need a different operation or result.",

Let's try calculating the sum step-by-step.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 2 + 4 + 9\n\nFINAL: The sum of the numbers [2, 2, 4, 9] is 17. Please specify if you need a different operation or result.",
