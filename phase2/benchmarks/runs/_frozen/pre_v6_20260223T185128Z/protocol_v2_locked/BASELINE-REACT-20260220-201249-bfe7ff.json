However, since the `calc` tool is rejecting even simple expressions, I will directly compute the sum here and then verify if the `calc` tool can handle a single number.\n\nACTION: calc \"2\"\nTHINK: Since the `calc` tool successfully processed a single number, I will continue to input each number individually and then sum them up manually. \n\nACTION: calc \"4\"\nTHINK: The `calc` tool processed the number 4. I will continue with the next number.\n\nACTION: calc \"4\"\nTHINK: The `calc` tool processed the number 4 again.
