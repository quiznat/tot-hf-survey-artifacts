    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [2, 3, 3, 9]. Since I only have access to a calculator tool and no specific instructions on what operation to perform, I should try to find a meaningful mathematical relationship or operation that can be applied to these numbers.\n\nLet me consider some possibilities:\n1. Sum all numbers: 2 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 17\n2. Product of all numbers: 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 9 = 162\n3. Find the average: (2 + 3 + 3 + 9) \u00f7 4 = 17 \u00f7 4 = 4.25\n\nSince there's no clear instruction on what to do, I'll start by calculating the sum as it's a basic operation that might be relevant.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 3 + 3",
