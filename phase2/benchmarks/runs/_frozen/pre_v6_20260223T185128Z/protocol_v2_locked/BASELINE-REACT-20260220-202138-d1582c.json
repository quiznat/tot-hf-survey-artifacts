    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [4, 4, 4, 10]. Since I only have access to a calculator tool, I should try to use it to perform some calculations that might help me solve this problem. The most logical approach would be to try different arithmetic operations on these numbers to see if I can reach a meaningful result or identify a pattern.\n\nLet me start by trying some basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with these numbers.\n\nACTION: calc 4 + 4 + 4 + 10\n\nScratchpad:",

Let me try multiplication and other combinations.\n\nACTION: calc 4 * 4 * 4 * 10\n\nScratchpad:\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: 640",

I'll try combinations like (4+4) * (4+10) or other groupings to see if I can find a more interesting relationship.\n\nACTION: calc (4 + 4) * (4 + 10)\n\nScratchpad:\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: 112\nSTEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I've tried several operations:\n- Addition: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22\n- Multiplication: 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 10 = 640\n- Mixed operation: (4 + 4) \u00d7 (4 + 10) = 112\n\nNone of these seem to lead to a clear pattern or",

Let me reconsider what the task might be asking for. Perhaps it's about finding a specific mathematical relationship or solving for an unknown variable. Since no explicit goal was given in the task, I should consider if there's another way to interpret or combine these numbers that could yield something more significant.\n\nLet me try calculating the product of pairs and then combining those results differently:\n\nACTION: calc (4 * 4) + (4 * 10)\n\nScratchpad:\nSTEP 4 OBSERVATION: 56\nSTEP 5 MODEL: THINK: I've now tried multiple approaches:\n- Simple addition: 22\n- Simple multiplication: 640",
