Since no specific operation is mentioned, I should explore what operations might be relevant or if there's a pattern in the numbers.\n\nLooking at the numbers [1, 2, 7, 10], I notice they're increasing but not by a constant difference (2-1=1, 7-2=5, 10-7=3). Let me try some basic calculations to see if I can find a meaningful result.\n\nACTION: calc 1+2+7+10\n\nScratchpad:",

Often these involve finding patterns, specific mathematical relationships, or applying standard algorithms.\n\nLooking more carefully at the numbers [1, 2, 7, 10], let me check if there's a pattern in differences:\n- 2 - 1 = 1\n- 7 - 2 = 5  \n- 10 - 7 = 3\n\nThe differences are 1, 5, 3 - this isn't arithmetic progression.\nLet me try calculating",
