    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents linear equations of the form ax + by = c. We have two equations:  \n1) 8x + 8y = -16  \n2) -5x + 8y = 62  \n\nWe need to solve this system of linear equations for x and y. Let's solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify equation 1: divide both sides by 8 \u2192 x + y = -2 \u2192 so y = -2 - x.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:  \n-5x + 8(-2 - x) = 62  \n\u2192 -5x -16 -8x = 62  \n\u2192 -13x -16 = 62  \n\u2192 -13x = 78  \n\u2192 x = -6\n\nThen y = -",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From STEP 1, we had derived x = -6. Now continuing: y = -2 - x = -2 - (-6) = -2 + 6 = 4. So the solution is x = -6, y = 4. Let's verify with both equations:\n\nEquation 1: 8x + 8y = 8(-6) + 8(4) = -48 + 32 = -16 \u2714\ufe0f  \nEquation 2: -5x + 8y = -5(-6) + 8(4) = 30 + 32 = 62 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nBoth equations are satisfied.
