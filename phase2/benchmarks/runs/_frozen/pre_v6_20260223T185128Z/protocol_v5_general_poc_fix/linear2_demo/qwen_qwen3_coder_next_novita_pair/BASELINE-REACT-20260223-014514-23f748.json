    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of two equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represents quadratic equations in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0.

Let's solve each.\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 - 3x = 0  \nFactor: x(x - 3) = 0 \u2192 x = 0 or x = 3\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + 7x - 30 = 0  \nWe need two numbers that multiply to -30 and add to 7:",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: We need two numbers that multiply to -30 and add to 7. These numbers are 10 and -3, since 10 \u00d7 (-3) = -30 and 10 + (-3) = 7. So we can factor:  \nx\u00b2 + 7x - 30 = (x + 10)(x - 3) = 0 \u2192 x = -10 or x = 3\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n- Equation 1: x = 0, 3  \n- Equation 2: x = -10, 3\n\nSince the task likely expects all solutions listed, we can present them as two sets or list all roots. Given the format, probably list roots for each equation.\n\nFinal answer: [[0, 3], [-10, 3]]\nFINAL: [[0, 3], [-10, 3"
