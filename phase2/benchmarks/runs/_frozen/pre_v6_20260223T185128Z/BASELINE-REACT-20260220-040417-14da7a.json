    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [2, 5, 5, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer what the goal might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing a sum, product, or checking for some property (e.g., can we make 24 using arithmetic operations?). Given the numbers [2, 5, 5, 7], a classic 24 game variant is plausible. Let me try to compute possible expressions.\n\nFirst, try simple operations:  \n2 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 19  \n2 * 5 + 5 + 7 = 10 + 5 + 7 = 22  \n2 + 5 * 5 - 7 = 2 + 25 - 7 = 20  \n(5",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [2, 5, 5, 7], and the only available tool is `calc`, which likely evaluates arithmetic expressions. Since the task is a benchmark and the numbers resemble those in the \"24 game\", a common goal is to use all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. Let me test candidate expressions.\n\nTry: (7 \u2212 5) \u00d7 (5 + 2) = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14 \u2192 too low  \nTry: 5 \u00d7 5 \u2212 (7 \u2212 2) = 25 \u2212 5 = 20  \nTry: 7 \u00d7 5 \u2212 5 \u00d7 2 = 35 \u2212 10 = 25  \nTry: (5 + 5) \u00d7 2 \u2212 7 = 10 \u00d7 2 \u2212 7 =",
