    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to use the numbers [4, 4, 10, 10] to reach a target value, likely 24 (standard 24 game), using arithmetic operations. Let me consider possible combinations.\n\nFirst, I know 10 + 10 + 4 = 24, but that only uses three numbers. I need to use all four numbers.\n\nLet me try: (10 - 4/4) * something? 4/4 = 1, so 10 - 1 = 9. Then 9 * ? = 24? 24/9 = 8/3, not helpful.\n\nWhat about (10 + 10) + (4 - 4) = 20 + 0 = 20 \u2014 no.\n\n(10 * 4) - (10 + 4) = 4",

Let me explore more systematically.\n\nTry: (10 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4) \u00f7 4 = (100 \u2212 4)/4 = 96/4 = 24. Yes! That uses all four numbers: 10, 10, 4, 4 \u2014 and yields 24.\n\nSo the expression is (10 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4) \u00f7 4 = 24.\n\nNow I should verify with the calc tool.\nACTION: calc (10 * 10 - 4) / 4\nFINAL: 24",
