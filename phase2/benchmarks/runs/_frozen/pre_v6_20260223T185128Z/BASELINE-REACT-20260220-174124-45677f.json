    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is a list of numbers: [1, 5, 8, 8]. The only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, the most likely benchmark task is to compute the result of applying standard arithmetic operations (e.g., sum, product, etc.) or perhaps to form an expression that evaluates to a target (like 24 game). Given the numbers [1, 5, 8, 8], and the common 24 game context, let\u2019s check if they can form 24.\n\nTry:  \n8 \u00d7 (5 - 1) - 8 = 8 \u00d7 4 - 8 = 32 - 8 = 24 \u2192 Yes!  \nSo expression: `8 * (5 - 1) - 8`\n\nLet\u2019s verify with `calc`.\n\nACTION",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [1, 5, 8, 8], and the goal is likely to form an expression using all four numbers exactly once with standard arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to reach 24 \u2014 a classic 24 game. I hypothesize the expression `8 * (5 - 1) - 8` works:  \n- (5 \u2212 1) = 4  \n- 8 \u00d7 4 = 32  \n- 32 \u2212 8 = 24  \nThis uses all numbers once.
