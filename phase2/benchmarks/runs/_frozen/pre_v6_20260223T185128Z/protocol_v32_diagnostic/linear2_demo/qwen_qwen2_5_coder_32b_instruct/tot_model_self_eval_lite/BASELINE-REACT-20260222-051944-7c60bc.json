If we have equations in the form ax + by = c, then:\n- First equation: -5x + (-7)y = -16 \u2192 -5x - 7y = -16\n- Second equation: -9x + 8y = -70\n\nI should try to solve this system of equations. Since I have two equations with two unknowns (x and y), I can use the solve2 tool if available, or I can work through it manually.\n\nLooking at the available tools:\n- check_xy: This might verify a",
