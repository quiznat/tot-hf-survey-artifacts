    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations to understand what they represent and how to solve them.\n\nLooking at the equations format [a, b, c], I need to determine what mathematical relationship these numbers represent. The most common interpretation would be equations of the form ax + by = c or similar linear relationships.\n\nLet me examine the two equations:\n- Equation 1: [4, 2, 36] \n- Equation 2: [2, 4, 18]\n\nThese could represent:\n- 4x + 2y = 36\n- 2x + 4y = 18\n\nThis is a system of linear equations with two variables. I should use the solve2 tool to find the solution for x and y.\n\nACTION: solve2 [\"[4, 2, 36]\", \"[2, 4, 18]\"]",
