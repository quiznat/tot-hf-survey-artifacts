    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables. The equations are:\n1) x + y = -8 and x - y = -29\n2) -x + y = -9 and -x - y = -39\n\nLet me analyze the structure. These appear to be systems where each equation has the form ax + by = c. I should use the solve2 tool to solve these systems.\n\nFirst, let me identify what the equations represent:\n- Equation 1: [1, -8, -29] means 1*x + (-8)*y = -29, so x - 8y = -29\n- Equation 2: [-1, -9, -39] means (-1)*x + (-9)*y = -39, so -x - 9y = -39\n\nWait, that doesn't match the format",

Let me reconsider - perhaps the format is [coefficient_of_x, coefficient_of_y, constant_term].\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the task, it seems like we have two separate systems:\nSystem 1: [1, -8, -29] and [-1, -9, -39] \nSystem 2",

This appears to be a list of two equations, each in the format [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c.\n\nHowever, there's an issue with the interpretation. If we have two equations, they should form a system. But the way it's structured suggests we might have two separate systems or there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the format [1, -8, -29], this represents the equation 1*x + (-8)*y = -29, which simplifies to x - 8y = -29.\nSimilarly, [-1, -9, -39] represents (-1)*x + (-9)*y = -39, which simplifies to -x",
