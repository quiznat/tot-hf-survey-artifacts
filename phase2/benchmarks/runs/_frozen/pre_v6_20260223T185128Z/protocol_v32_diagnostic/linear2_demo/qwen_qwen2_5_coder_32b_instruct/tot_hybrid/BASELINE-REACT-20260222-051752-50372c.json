    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of linear equations. The equations are given as:\n- Equation 1: 0x + 1y = 7\n- Equation 2: 9x + 2y = -31\n\nThis is a system of two equations with two unknowns (x and y). I can use the solve2 tool which is designed for solving systems of two linear equations.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the coefficients:\n- For equation 1: a1=0, b1=1, c1=7\n- For equation 2: a2=9, b2=2, c2=-31\n\nI should use the solve2 tool with these coefficients.\nACTION: solve2 0 1 7 9 2 -31\nFINAL: [x=-5, y=7]"
