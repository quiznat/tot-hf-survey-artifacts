    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what to do next. The input shows two equations in the form [a, b, c] which likely represents ax + by = c. So we have:\n- Equation 1: -9x + 7y = 15\n- Equation 2: -2x + 0y = 8\n\nSince the second equation has a coefficient of 0 for y, it simplifies to -2x = 8, which means x = -4. \n\nI can use the solve2 tool to solve this system of equations, or I could use check_xy to verify potential solutions. Since I have a clear system to solve, I'll use solve2.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-9, 7, 15, -2, 0, 8]\n\nFINAL: [-4, -3]"
