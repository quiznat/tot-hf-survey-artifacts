    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables. The equations are:\n1) x + y = -8 and x - y = -29\n2) -x + y = -9 and -x - y = -39\n\nLet me analyze the structure. These appear to be systems where each equation has the form ax + by = c. I should use the solve2 tool which is designed for solving systems of two linear equations in two variables.\n\nLooking at the first system: [1, -8, -29] represents x + (-8)y = -29, but this doesn't match the format I expect. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the format, it seems like each list contains coefficients [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. But that would mean:\n- First equation: 1x + (-8)y = -29",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me re-examine the problem format. Looking at the equations [[1, -8, -29], [-1, -9, -39]], each sublist [a, b, c] represents the equation ax + by = c.\n\nSo the first system is:\n- Equation 1: 1x + (-8)y = -29 \u2192 x - 8y = -29\n- Equation 2: (-1)x + (-9)y = -39 \u2192 -x - 9y = -39\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right either. Let me look at this differently. \n\nIf we have [1, -8, -29], and we want ax + by = c, then:\n- a = 1, b = -8, c = -29\n- So the equation is 1x + (-8)y = -29, or x",

If we have [-1, -9, -39], that means -1\u00b7x + (-9)\u00b7y = -39, which is -x - 9y = -39.\n\nHowever, looking at the original problem statement again, it says \"the equations are: 1x + y = -8 and x - y",

It says \"the equations are: 1x + y = -8 and x - y = -29\" and \"the equations are: -x + y = -9 and -x - y = -39\".\n\nThis suggests there are actually 4 equations total, not 2 systems.
