    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables. The equations are:\n-1x + 0y = -5  (or simply -x = -5)\n7x - 4y = 35\n\nI can see that the first equation is already solved for x, so I could substitute this into the second equation. However, I should use the available tools. I have \"solve2\" which likely solves systems of equations, and \"check_xy\" which probably verifies solutions.\n\nLet me try using solve2 first to get the solution.\nACTION: solve2 [-1, 0, -5, 7, -4, 35]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I've obtained the solution from the solve2 tool: x = 5 and y = 0. Now I should verify this solution by substituting these values back into both original equations to ensure they are satisfied.\n\nLet me check the first equation: -1x + 0y = -5\nSubstituting x = 5, y = 0: -1(5) + 0(0) = -5 \u2713\n\nLet me check the second equation: 7x - 4y = 35\nSubstituting x = 5, y = 0: 7(5) - 4(0) = 35 \u2713\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct. I should now provide the final answer.\nFINAL: x = 5, y = 0"
