    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what operations are needed to solve them. The equations are presented as lists of three numbers each, which likely represent systems of linear equations in the form ax + by = c.\n\nLooking at the first equation [-5, -7, -16], this could be interpreted as -5x - 7y = -16\nLooking at the second equation [-9, 8, -70], this could be interpreted as -9x + 8y = -70\n\nI should use the solve2 tool to solve this system of equations. The solve2 tool takes two equations in the format [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-5, -7, -16] [-9, 8, -70]",
