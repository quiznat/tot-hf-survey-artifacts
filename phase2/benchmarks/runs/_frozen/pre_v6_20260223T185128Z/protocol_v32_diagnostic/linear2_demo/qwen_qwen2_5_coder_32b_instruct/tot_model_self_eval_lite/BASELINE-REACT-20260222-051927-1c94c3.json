    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what operations are needed. The equations are presented as lists of three numbers each. Looking at the format [a, b, c], this likely represents a system of equations where we're looking for values of x and y that satisfy both equations.\n\nLet me examine the equations:\n- First equation: [9, 0, 72] - This could be 9x + 0y = 72\n- Second equation: [7, 4, 92] - This could be 7x + 4y = 92\n\nThis is a system of linear equations. I can use the solve2 tool to solve this system directly.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[9, 0, 72], [7, 4, 92]]",
