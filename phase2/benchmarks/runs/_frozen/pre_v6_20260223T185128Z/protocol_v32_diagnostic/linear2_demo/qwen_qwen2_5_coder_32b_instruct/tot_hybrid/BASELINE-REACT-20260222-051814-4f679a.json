    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what to do next. The input shows two equations in the form [a, b, c] which likely represent ax + by = c. So I have:\n- Equation 1: 5x + (-6)y = -42\n- Equation 2: (-4)x + 6y = 36\n\nI should first check if these equations can be solved using the available tools. Since I have two equations with two unknowns (x and y), I can use the solve2 tool. However, I should first verify that the system is solvable by checking if the equations are consistent.\n\nLet me try to solve this system directly using the solve2 tool since it's designed for solving systems of two linear equations with two variables.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[5, -6, -42], [-4, 6, 36]]",
