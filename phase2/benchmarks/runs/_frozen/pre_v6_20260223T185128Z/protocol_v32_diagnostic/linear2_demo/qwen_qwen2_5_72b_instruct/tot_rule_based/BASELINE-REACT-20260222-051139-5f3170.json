    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this benchmark task, I need to first understand what the provided equations represent. The given list structure suggests a system of linear equations in the form of Ax + By = C for each equation. The next step would be to use the `solve2` tool to find the solution (x, y) that satisfies both equations. Let's proceed with this plan.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-9, -9, -99] [9, 3, 45]",
