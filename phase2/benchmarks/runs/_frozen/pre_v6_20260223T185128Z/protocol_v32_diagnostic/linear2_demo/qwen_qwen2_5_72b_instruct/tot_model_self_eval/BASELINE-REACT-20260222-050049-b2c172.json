    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The provided task involves solving a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. Each list within the 'equations' key represents an equation where the first two elements are the coefficients of x and y respectively, and the last element is the constant term. We have two equations here, which can be solved simultaneously for the values of x and y. The available tools include `check_xy` to verify the solution and `solve2` to actually find the solution. Since we need to find the values of x and y first, I will use the `solve2` tool with the given equations as input.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-2, 5, 3] [8, 2, -34]",
