    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: We have a system of linear equations represented in the form of two lists within a list, where each inner list represents an equation with coefficients for x and y, followed by the constant term on the right side of the equation. The equations can be written as follows:\n1) -5x + 7y = -41\n2) 5x + 7y = -1\n\nTo find the solution (x, y), we should use the `solve2` function, which is designed to solve systems of linear equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-5, 7, -41] [5, 7, -1]",
