    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to solve a system of linear equations. The input is a list of equations in the form of [a, b, c] which represents the equation ax + by = c. I have two available tools: 'check_xy' which likely checks if a given (x, y) pair satisfies the given equations, and 'solve2' which seems like it could solve a system of two linear equations. Since we need to find the solution for x and y, I should use the 'solve2' tool with the provided equations as input.\n\nACTION: solve2 {'equations': [[7, 7, 42], [-5, 9, 82]]}",
