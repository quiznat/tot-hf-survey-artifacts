    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to solve a system of linear equations represented in matrix form, where each equation is [a, b, c] corresponding to ax + by = c. I need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The available tools are `check_xy` which likely checks if a solution (x, y) satisfies the equations, and `solve2` which seems to be designed to solve a system of two linear equations. I will use `solve2` with the coefficients from the equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 2 7 -30 -6 3 42",
