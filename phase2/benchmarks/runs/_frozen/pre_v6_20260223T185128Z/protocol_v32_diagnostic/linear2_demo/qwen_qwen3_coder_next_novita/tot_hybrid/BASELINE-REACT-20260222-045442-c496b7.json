    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides the coefficients in the form of equations:  \nEquation 1: -8x - 3y = -66  \nEquation 2: 1x - 8y = -42  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a system of two linear equations given their coefficients. Let me confirm the format: each inner list is [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So:  \n- First equation: a1 = -8, b1 = -3, c1 = -66  \n- Second equation: a2 = 1, b2 = -8, c2 = -42  \n\nI'll use `solve2` with these coefficients.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-8, -3,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x = 6.0 and y = 6.0 as the solution to the system of equations.
