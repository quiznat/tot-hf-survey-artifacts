    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations like a*x + b*y = c or possibly a*x*y = c? But more commonly, in linear equation contexts, [a, b, c] could mean a*x + b*y = c. However, the numbers don't suggest simple linear equations: For [9, 6, 48], if it's 9x + 6y = 48, that simplifies to 3x + 2y = 16. For [-7, 5, 40], -7x + 5y = 40.\n\nBut the presence of tools `check_xy` and `solve2` suggests we need to find values for x and y that satisfy both equations. Let's assume the equations are linear:  \nEquation 1: 9x + 6y =",

The available tools are `check_xy` (likely verifies if given x, y satisfy the equations) and `solve2` (probably solves a 2-equation system). Since we have exactly two linear equations, `solve2` is the appropriate tool to directly obtain the solution. Let's call `solve2` with the two equations.",
