    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -9x + 1y = -37 \u2192 y = 9x - 37\nEquation 2: 8x - 6y = -8\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution using the first equation (already solved for y).\n\nSubstitute y = 9x - 37 into the second equation:\n8x - 6(9x - 37) = -8  \n8x - 54x + 222 = -8  \n-46x + 222 = -8  \n-46x = -230  \nx",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From the scratchpad, we have derived that -46x = -230, so x = (-230)/(-46) = 5. Now we can substitute x = 5 into y = 9x - 37 to find y: y = 9*5 - 37 = 45 - 37 = 8. So the solution is x = 5, y = 8. To verify, we can use the `check_xy` tool to confirm both equations are satisfied. Let's do that.",
