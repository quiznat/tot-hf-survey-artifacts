    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \nEquation 1: a1*x + b1*y = c1 \u2192 -9x + 1y = -37  \nEquation 2: a2*x + b2*y = c2 \u2192 8x - 6y = -8  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system given the coefficient matrix and constants. Let me prepare the input for `solve2`. Typically, `solve2` expects either the augmented matrix or separate coefficient and constant arrays. Given the format of the input, it's likely `solve2` takes the list of equations as provided. Let",

The `solve2` tool is designed for solving 2-variable linear systems, and the input format matches what it likely expects (each inner list is [coeff_x, coeff_y, constant]).
