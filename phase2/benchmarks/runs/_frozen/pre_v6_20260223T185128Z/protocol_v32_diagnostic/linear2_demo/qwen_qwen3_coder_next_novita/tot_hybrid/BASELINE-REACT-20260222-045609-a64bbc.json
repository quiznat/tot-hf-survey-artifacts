To verify correctness, I should use the `check_xy` tool with x = -9 and y = 6.  \nAlternatively, I could use `solve2`, which likely solves the system directly. Since `solve2` is designed for solving 2-variable linear systems, it's more efficient to call it directly with the equations. The input format for `solve2` is likely the list of equations: [[7, 7, -21], [8, -4, -96]].  \nI'll use `solve2` to get the solution.\nACTION:",
