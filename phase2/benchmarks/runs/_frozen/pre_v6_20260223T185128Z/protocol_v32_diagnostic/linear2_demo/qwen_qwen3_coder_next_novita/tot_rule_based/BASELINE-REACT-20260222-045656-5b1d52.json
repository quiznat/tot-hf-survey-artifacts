    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides the equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n1) -5x + 7y = -41\n2) 5x + 7y = -1\n\nI can solve this system manually or use the available tools. Let's consider using solve2, which likely solves a system of two equations. Alternatively, check_xy could verify a candidate solution.\n\nFirst, I can try to solve manually: Adding the two equations eliminates x:\n(-5x + 7y) + (5x + 7y) = -41 + (-1)\n\u2192 14y = -42 \u2192 y = -3\n\nSubstitute y = -3 into equation 2: 5x + 7(-3) = -1 \u2192 5x - 2",
