    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n1) a1*x + b1*y = c1  \n2) a2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nGiven equations:  \n1) 8x + 6y = -22  \n2) 1x + 1y = -4  \n\nI can either solve manually or use the `solve2` tool if it's designed for this purpose. Since `solve2` is available and likely intended for solving 2-variable linear systems, I'll use it. But first, I need to confirm what format `solve2` expects \u2014 likely the coefficients as given. Let me try calling `solve2` with the equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[8, 6, -22",
