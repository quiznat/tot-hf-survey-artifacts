    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 6x + 1y = 28\nEquation 2: 8x + 6y = 0\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve the system. Let's try to use the solve2 tool, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. But first, let's verify what solve2 expects as input. Since it's not specified, and we have two equations, we can pass both equations to solve2.\n\nAlternatively, we could use check_xy to verify candidate solutions, but we don\u2019t yet have a candidate. So better to call solve2 directly with the system.\n\nLet\u2019s assume solve2 takes a list of equations in the same format",
