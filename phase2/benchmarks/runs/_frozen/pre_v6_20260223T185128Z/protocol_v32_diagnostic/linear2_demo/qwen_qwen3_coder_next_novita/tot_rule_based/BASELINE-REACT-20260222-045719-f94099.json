    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of equations. The input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations like a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) 4x + 2y = 36  \n2) 2x + 4y = 18  \n\nWe need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-variable system). Since we have exactly two linear equations with two variables, `solve2` is appropriate here.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[4, 2, 36], [2, 4, 18]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solution returned by solve2 is x=9.0, y=0.0. Let's verify this solution using the original equations:\n1) 4x + 2y = 4*9 + 2*0 = 36 + 0 = 36 \u2713  \n2) 2x + 4y = 2*9 + 4*0 = 18 + 0 = 18 \u2713  \n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct. Since we have verified the solution, we can now provide the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=9.0, y=0.0"
