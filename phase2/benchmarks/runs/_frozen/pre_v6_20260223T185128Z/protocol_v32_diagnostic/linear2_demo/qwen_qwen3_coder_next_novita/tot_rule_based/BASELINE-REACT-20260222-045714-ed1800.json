The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \na1*x + b1*y = c1  \na2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nSo here:  \n5x - 5y = 65  \n6x - 2y = 42  \n\nWe can simplify the first equation by dividing by 5: x - y = 13 \u2192 x = y + 13.  \nSubstitute into second: 6(y+13) - 2y = 42 \u2192 6y + 78 - 2y = 42 \u2192 4y = -36 \u2192 y = -9.  \nThen x = -9 + 13 = 4.  \n\nSo solution is x=",
