    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -9x + 7y = 15  \nEquation 2: -2x + 0y = 8 \u2192 -2x = 8 \u2192 x = -4\n\nWe can solve this system manually or use the available tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. The input format for `solve2` is probably the two equations as lists, matching the input structure.\n\nAlternatively, `check_xy` might verify a proposed solution (x, y), but we don\u2019t yet have a candidate solution.\n\nSince we already see that Equation 2 gives x directly: x = -4, we can substitute into Equation 1:\n-9(-4) + 7y",

So solution is (x, y) = (-4, -3). Now we can verify using `check_xy` or directly output using `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely expects the same format as input, and we have the answer, we can use `solve2` with the equations to get the solution. Let's use `solve2` directly.",
