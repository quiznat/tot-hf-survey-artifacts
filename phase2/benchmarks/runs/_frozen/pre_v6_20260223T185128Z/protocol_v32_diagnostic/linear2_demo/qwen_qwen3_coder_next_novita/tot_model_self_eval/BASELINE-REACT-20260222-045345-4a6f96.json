    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], which likely represent linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) 5x - 5y = 65\n2) 6x - 2y = 42\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve this system. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2x2 system directly). Given that `solve2` is available and the input format matches two equations, it's most efficient to use `solve2` directly.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[5, -5, 65], [6, -2, 42]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solution from `solve2` gives x=4.0, y=-9.0. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool by plugging x=4 and y=-9 into both original equations:  \n1) 5x - 5y = 5*4 - 5*(-9) = 20 + 45 = 65 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) 6x - 2y = 6*4 - 2*(-9) = 24 + 18 = 42 \u2714\ufe0f  \nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\n\nACTION: check_xy 4 -9\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: True\nFINAL: x=4, y=-9"
