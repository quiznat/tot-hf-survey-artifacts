So the equations are:\n1) 8x - 4y = -60\n2) -6x + 5y = 47\n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can use the solve2 tool, which is likely designed to solve 2x2 linear systems. Let me try that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[8, -4, -60], [-6, 5, 47]]",

To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution by plugging it back into both original equations.\n\nEquation 1: 8x - 4y = 8*(-7) - 4*(1) = -56 - 4 = -60 \u2713  \nEquation 2: -6x + 5y = -6*(-7) + 5*(1) = 42 + 5 = 47 \u2713  \n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\n\nFINAL: x=-7,y=1"
