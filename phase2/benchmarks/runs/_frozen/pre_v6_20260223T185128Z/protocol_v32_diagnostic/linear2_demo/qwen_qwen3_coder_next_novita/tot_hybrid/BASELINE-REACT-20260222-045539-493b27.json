    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input contains two equations represented as coefficient arrays: [[-9, 7, 15], [-2, 0, 8]]. Each inner list likely represents an equation in the form ax + by = c. So:\n- First equation: -9x + 7y = 15\n- Second equation: -2x + 0y = 8 \u2192 -2x = 8 \u2192 x = -4\n\nWe can solve this system manually or use the available tools. Since solve2 is available and likely designed for solving 2-variable linear systems, I should use it. The input format for solve2 is probably the coefficient matrix and constants \u2014 possibly as [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], which matches our input.\n\nLet me use solve2 with the given equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-9, 7, 1",

Let me verify this solution using the original equations:\n- First equation: -9x + 7y = -9(-4) + 7(-3) = 36 - 21 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Second equation: -2x + 0y = -2(-4) = 8 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct. I can now provide the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=-4,y=-3"
