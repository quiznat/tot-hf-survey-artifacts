    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays: [-1, 6, -16] and [-1, -9, 14]. These likely represent quadratic equations of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where each list is [a, b, c]. So the equations are:\n1. -x\u00b2 + 6x - 16 = 0\n2. -x\u00b2 - 9x + 14 = 0\n\nWe need to solve these equations. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two equations (given the name), and we have two equations, it's appropriate to use `solve2`. Let's assume `solve2` expects input as a list of equations, each represented as [a, b, c] for ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0",
