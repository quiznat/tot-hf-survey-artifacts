    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays: [1, -8, -29] and [-1, -9, -39]. These likely represent quadratic equations of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. So:\n- Equation 1: x\u00b2 - 8x - 29 = 0\n- Equation 2: -x\u00b2 - 9x - 39 = 0 (or equivalently, x\u00b2 + 9x + 39 = 0 after multiplying by -1)\n\nThe available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two equations, and we have two equations, I should use `solve2` to find solutions (x, y) \u2014 but wait, the equations are univariate (only x).
