    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -2x + 5y = 3  \nEquation 2: 8x + 2y = -34  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can use algebraic methods (e.g., substitution or elimination), or use the provided tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. The input format for `solve2` is probably the list of equations, i.e., [[-2,5,3],[8,2,-34]]. Let's try that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-2,5,3],[8,2,-34]]",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: x=-4.000000,y=-1.000000",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool successfully solved the system of equations and returned x = -4.0 and y = -1.0. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool by plugging x = -4 and y = -1 into both original equations:  \nEquation 1: -2x + 5y = -2(-4) + 5(-1) = 8 - 5 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f  \nEquation 2: 8x + 2y = 8(-4) + 2(-1) = -32 - 2 = -34 \u2714\ufe0f  \nVerification confirms the solution is correct. I can now report the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=-4,y=-1"
