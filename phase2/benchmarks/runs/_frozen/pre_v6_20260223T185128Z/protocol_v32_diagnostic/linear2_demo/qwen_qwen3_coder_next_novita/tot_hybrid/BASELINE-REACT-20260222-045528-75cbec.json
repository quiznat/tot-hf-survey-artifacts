    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form of equations: [[-1, 2, -15], [3, -5, 41]].

Since `solve2` is available and likely designed for this purpose, I should use it. I need to determine the correct input format. Given the input was provided as `[[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]]`, it's reasonable that `solve2` expects the same structure: coefficients and constants on the right-hand side. So input should be `[[ -1, 2, -15 ], [ 3, -5, 41 ]]`. Alternatively, some solvers expect just the coefficient matrix and RHS separately, but since the task input matches the format of augmented rows, `solve2` likely accepts the full list. Let",
