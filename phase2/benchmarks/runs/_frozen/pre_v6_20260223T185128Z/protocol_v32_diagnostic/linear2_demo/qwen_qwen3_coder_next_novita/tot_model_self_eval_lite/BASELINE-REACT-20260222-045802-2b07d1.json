    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form of equations: [[-5, 7, -41], [5, 7, -1]]. Each inner list represents an equation in the form ax + by = c. So the system is:\n- Equation 1: -5x + 7y = -41\n- Equation 2: 5x + 7y = -1\n\nI can solve this system manually or use the available tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a system of two equations. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution. Since I don\u2019t yet have a solution, I should try `solve2` first.\n\nThe `solve2` tool probably expects input in a structured format \u2014 perhaps the coefficients as given. Let me try calling `solve2` with the equations.\n\nACTION: solve2",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned a solution: x = 4.0, y = -3.0. I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool to ensure it satisfies both original equations:  \n- Equation 1: -5x + 7y = -5(4) + 7(-3) = -20 - 21 = -41 \u2714\ufe0f  \n- Equation 2: 5x + 7y = 5(4) + 7(-3) = 20 - 21 = -1 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nVerification confirms the solution is correct. I can now provide the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=4,y=-3"
