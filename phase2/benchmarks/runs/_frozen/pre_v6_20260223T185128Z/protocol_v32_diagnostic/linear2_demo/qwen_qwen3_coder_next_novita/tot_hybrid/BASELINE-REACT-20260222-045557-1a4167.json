    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:  \n1) 8x - 4y = -60  \n2) -6x + 5y = 47  \n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the available tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the coefficients matrix and constants vector \u2014 possibly as a list of equations like given. So I'll try calling `solve2` with the equations list.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[8, -4, -60], [-6, 5, 47]]",
