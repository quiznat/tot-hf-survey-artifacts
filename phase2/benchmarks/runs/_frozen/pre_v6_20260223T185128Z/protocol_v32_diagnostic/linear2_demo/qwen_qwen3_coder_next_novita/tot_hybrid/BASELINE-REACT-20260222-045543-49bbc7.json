    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \na1*x + b1*y = c1  \na2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nSo here:  \n5x - 5y = 65  \n6x - 2y = 42  \n\nI need to find x and y. I can either solve manually or use the available tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2x2 system. If not, I can use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions. First, try `solve2` with the equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[5, -5, 65], [6, -2, 42]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x=4.0, y=-9.0 as a solution. I should verify this solution using the original equations to ensure correctness.\n\nCheck first equation: 5x - 5y = 5*4 - 5*(-9) = 20 + 45 = 65 \u2714\ufe0f  \nCheck second equation: 6x - 2y = 6*4 - 2*(-9) = 24 + 18 = 42 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nBoth equations are satisfied. Alternatively, I could use `check_xy` to confirm, but manual verification already confirms correctness. Since the solution is validated, I can now report the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=4, y=-9"
