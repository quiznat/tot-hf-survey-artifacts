    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n1) a1*x + b1*y = c1 \u2192 1*x + 1*y = 3  \n2) a2*x + b2*y = c2 \u2192 -2*x + 3*y = -36  \n\nI need to find (x, y) satisfying both. I can either use algebraic solving or call the `solve2` tool if it's designed for this. Since `solve2` is available and likely intended for solving 2-variable linear systems, I'll use it. The input format for `solve2` should match the equations structure: probably the list of coefficient triplets.\n\nLet me call `solve2` with the equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[1,",
