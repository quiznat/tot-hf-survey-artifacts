    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays: [1, -8, -29] and [-1, -9, -39]. These likely represent quadratic equations of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. So:\n- Equation 1: x\u00b2 - 8x - 29 = 0\n- Equation 2: -x\u00b2 - 9x - 39 = 0 (or equivalently, x\u00b2 + 9x + 39 = 0 after multiplying by -1)\n\nThe available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since the task is to solve equations, `solve2` is likely the appropriate tool to use for solving two equations (possibly a system, but here they are separate quadratics). Let\u2019s assume `solve2` takes the two equations as input.\n\nWe need to pass the equations to `solve2",

The available tools are `check_xy` (probably for verifying a point (x,y) against equations) and `solve2` (likely for solving two equations). Since the equations are separate quadratics (not a system), `solve2` may be designed for solving a *system* of two equations in two variables \u2014 but here we have two single-variable quadratics. Alternatively, `solve2` might accept two coefficient arrays and return roots for both. Given the context, `solve2` is the most promising tool to call with the list of equations.
