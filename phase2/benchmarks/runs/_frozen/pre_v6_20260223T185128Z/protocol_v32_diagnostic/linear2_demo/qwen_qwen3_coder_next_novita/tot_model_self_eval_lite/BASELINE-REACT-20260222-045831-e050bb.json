    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \nEquation 1: 6x - 7y = -18  \nEquation 2: 4x + 4y = 40  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system given the coefficient matrix and constants. Let me format the input appropriately for `solve2`. Typically, `solve2` expects the augmented matrix or separate coefficient and constant arrays. Since the format of the input is [[6, -7, -18], [4, 4, 40]], it's likely that each row is [coeff_x, coeff_y, constant], so",

The `solve2` tool is designed for 2\u00d72 linear systems. Given the structure, `solve2` likely expects the coefficient matrix and constant vector, or possibly the augmented matrix. Since the input is already in the form of augmented rows, I should pass the entire list to `solve2`. Let me try calling `solve2` with the equations as provided.  \nACTION: solve2 [[6, -7, -18], [4, 4, 40]]",
