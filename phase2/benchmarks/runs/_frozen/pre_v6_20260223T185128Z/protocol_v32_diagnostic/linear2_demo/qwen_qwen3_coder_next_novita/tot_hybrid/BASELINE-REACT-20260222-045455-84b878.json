    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations of the form a*x + b*y = c.

The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a system of two linear equations). Since we have exactly two equations, `solve2` is appropriate. Let's use `solve2` with the list of equations.\n\nTool input for `solve2` should probably be the list of equations: [[7, 7, 42], [-5, 9, 82]].\n\nACTION: solve2 [[7, 7, 42], [-",

Let's verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool to ensure it satisfies both equations:  \n1) 7x + 7y = 7*(-2) + 7*8 = -14 + 56 = 42 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) -5x + 9y = -5*(-2) + 9*8 = 10 + 72 = 82 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nThe solution is correct. Since verification is straightforward and the task likely expects the final answer, I can now provide the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=-2,y=8"
