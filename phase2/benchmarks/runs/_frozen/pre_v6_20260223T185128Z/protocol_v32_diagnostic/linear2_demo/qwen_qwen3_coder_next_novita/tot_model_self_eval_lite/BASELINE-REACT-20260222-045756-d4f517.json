    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c.

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: We have x = 4. Now substitute into one of the original equations to find y. Using equation 1: 8x - 7y = 46 \u2192 8*4 - 7y = 46 \u2192 32 - 7y = 46 \u2192 -7y = 14 \u2192 y = -2. So solution is (x, y) = (4, -2). Let's verify with the second equation: 9*4 - 5*(-2) = 36 + 10 = 46 \u2713. The solution is correct. Since we have the answer, we can now use the check_xy tool to verify or directly output the final answer. Given the task likely expects the solution, and we've verified it, we'll go with FINAL.\nFINAL: (4, -2)"
