    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \nEquation 1: a1\u00b7x + b1\u00b7y = c1 \u2192 8x + y = -24  \nEquation 2: a2\u00b7x + b2\u00b7y = c2 \u2192 6x - 8y = -18  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which is likely designed for solving 2\u00d72 linear systems. Let me try that first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[8, 1, -24], [6, -8, -18]]",
