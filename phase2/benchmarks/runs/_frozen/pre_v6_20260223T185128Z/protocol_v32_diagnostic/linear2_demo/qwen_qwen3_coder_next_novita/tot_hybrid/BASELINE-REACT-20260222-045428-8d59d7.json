    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of equations, but the input format is unusual: [[9, 0, 72], [7, 4, 92]]. This likely represents two linear equations in two variables (say x and y), where each row [a, b, c] corresponds to the equation a*x + b*y = c. So:\n- Equation 1: 9x + 0y = 72 \u2192 9x = 72 \u2192 x = 8\n- Equation 2: 7x + 4y = 92\n\nSince x = 8 from the first equation, substitute into the second: 7*8 + 4y = 92 \u2192 56 + 4y = 92 \u2192 4y = 36 \u2192 y = 9.\n\nThus, solution is x = 8, y = 9.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The system of equations is [[9, 0, 72], [7, 4, 92]], interpreted as:\n- 9x + 0y = 72 \u2192 x = 8\n- 7x + 4y = 92 \u2192 substitute x = 8: 56 + 4y = 92 \u2192 4y = 36 \u2192 y = 9\n\nSo the solution is x = 8, y = 9. I should verify this using the available tools. The `check_xy` tool likely verifies a candidate solution (x, y), and `solve2` might solve a 2-variable system. Since I already solved it manually, I'll use `check_xy` to confirm (8, 9) satisfies both equations.\n\nACTION: check_xy 8 9",
