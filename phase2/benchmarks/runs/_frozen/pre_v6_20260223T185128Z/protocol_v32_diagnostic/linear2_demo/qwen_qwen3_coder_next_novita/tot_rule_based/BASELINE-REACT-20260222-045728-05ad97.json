Let's consider using solve2, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system given coefficients.\n\nBut first, let's verify: solve2 probably expects input like [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], which matches our input. So we can directly call solve2 with the given equations.\n\nAlternatively, we could solve step-by-step:\nFrom Eq1: -5x = 25 \u2192 x = -5.\nPlug into Eq2: 1*(-5) +",
