    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input contains a list of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -2x + 5y = 3  \nEquation 2: 8x + 2y = -34  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since there are two equations and two unknowns, we can use a solver tool. The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2x2 system). Given the input format matches what `solve2` probably expects (list of equations), I should call `solve2` with the equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-2, 5, 3], [8, 2, -34]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The solver returned x = -4.0 and y = -1.0 as the solution. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool with the original equations.
