    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -4x - y = 24  \nEquation 2: -6x - 6y = 0  \n\nWe need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. Let's first try to solve using algebraic manipulation or use the available tools. Since we have `solve2` as a tool, it likely solves a 2-variable linear system. Let's try using `solve2` with the coefficient matrix and constants.\n\nThe standard form for `solve2` would likely expect input as two equations in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], which matches our input. So we can directly pass the equations.\n\nAlternatively",

Since `solve2` is designed for 2-variable linear systems and the input format matches typical usage (each equation as [a, b, c] for ax + by = c), we should use `solve2` first to obtain the solution. Let's call `solve2` with the given equations.\nACTION: solve2 [[-4, -1, 24], [-6, -6, 0]]",

To ensure correctness, we should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool by plugging x = -8 and y = 8 into both original equations:\n- Equation 1: -4x - y = -4(-8) - 8 = 32 - 8 = 24 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Equation 2: -6x - 6y = -6(-8) - 6(8) = 48 - 48 = 0 \u2714\ufe0f  \nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\nACTION: check_xy -8 8\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: True\nFINAL: x=-8,y=8"
