    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations like a*x + b*y = c or possibly a*x*y = c, but more context is needed. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` suggests solving a system of two equations, and we have two equations, I should try using `solve2` first to find solutions for x and y. Let me call `solve2` with the list of equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[9, 6, 48], [-7, 5, 40]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x=0.000000, y=8.000000 as a solution. Let me verify this using the `check_xy` tool to ensure the solution satisfies both equations. The equations are [9, 6, 48] and [-7, 5, 40], likely representing 9x + 6y = 48 and -7x + 5y = 40. Plugging in x=0, y=8:  \n- First equation: 9*0 + 6*8 = 48 \u2192 48 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f  \n- Second equation: -7*0 + 5*8 = 40 \u2192 40 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nSo the solution is correct. I should now confirm with `check_xy`.\n\nACTION: check_xy",
