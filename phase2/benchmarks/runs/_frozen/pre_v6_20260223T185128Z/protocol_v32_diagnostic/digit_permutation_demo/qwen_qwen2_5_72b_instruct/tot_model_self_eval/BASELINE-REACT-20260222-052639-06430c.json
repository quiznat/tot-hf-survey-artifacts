    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits, which is divisible by the provided divisor (8 in this case), and does not exceed the oracle_max value (8312). I should first try to form the largest possible number from the digits and then check if it's divisible by 8 and within the limit. If not, I will use the tools to find the best solution.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [8, 2, 3, 1], \"divisor\": 8, \"max_value\": 8312}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function has returned 8312, which means that 8312 is the largest number that can be formed from the given digits [8, 2, 3, 1] and is divisible by 8, without exceeding the `oracle_max` value of 8312. Since 8312 is exactly equal to the `oracle_max`, it is the optimal solution for this task.\n\nFINAL: 8312"
