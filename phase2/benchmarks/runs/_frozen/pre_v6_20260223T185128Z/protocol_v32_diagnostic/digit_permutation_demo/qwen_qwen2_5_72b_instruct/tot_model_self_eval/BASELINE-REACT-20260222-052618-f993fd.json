First, I will generate all possible numbers from the digits and check if they are divisible by 7 using the `is_divisible` tool. Then, I will use the `best_divisible` tool to find the largest valid number.\n\nACTION: is_divisible [1159, 1195, 1519, 1591, 1915, 1951, 5119, 5191, 5911, 9115, 9151, 9511] 7",
