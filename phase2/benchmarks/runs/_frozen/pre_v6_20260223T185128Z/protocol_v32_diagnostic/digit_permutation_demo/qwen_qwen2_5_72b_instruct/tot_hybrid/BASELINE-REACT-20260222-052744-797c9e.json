    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the given divisor and does not exceed the oracle_max value. I should first try to form the largest possible number from the given digits and then check if it is divisible by the divisor. If it is not, I will need to try other combinations or decrement the number until it is divisible.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 1, 5, 6], \"divisor\": 7, \"max_value\": 6531}",
