However, since the digits provided are [6, 9, 2, 5], the number 9625 cannot be formed with these digits. I need to check if 9625 is actually divisible by 11 and then proceed to form the largest possible number from the given digits that is also divisible by 11 and does not exceed 9625.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 9625, \"divisor\": 11}",
