    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the provided divisor and is also less than or equal to the oracle_max value. I should start by attempting to form the largest possible number from the given digits and then check if it is divisible by the divisor. If not, I will adjust the number accordingly.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 1, 6, 2], \"divisor\": 4, \"max_value\": 6312}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function has returned 6312, which is the `oracle_max` value itself. This means that either 6312 is the largest number that can be formed from the given digits and is divisible by 4, or there might be a larger number within the constraints that is divisible by 4. However, since 6312 is the maximum allowed value and it is returned, it suggests that 6312 is indeed divisible by 4 and formed from the given digits. To confirm this, I should check if 6312 is divisible by 4 and if it can be formed from the given digits.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 6312, \"divisor\": 4}",
