    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the given divisor (3 in this case), and it should not exceed the maximum value provided (9762). I will start by generating the largest possible number from the digits and then check if it's divisible by 3. If not, I'll use the available tools to find the correct number.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {'digits': [9, 7, 6, 2], 'divisor': 3}",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 9762",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` tool returned 9762, which means it is the largest number that can be formed from the given digits [9, 7, 6, 2] that is divisible by 3 and does not exceed the maximum value of 9762. Since the result matches the `oracle_max`, we can conclude that 9762 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nFINAL: 9762"
