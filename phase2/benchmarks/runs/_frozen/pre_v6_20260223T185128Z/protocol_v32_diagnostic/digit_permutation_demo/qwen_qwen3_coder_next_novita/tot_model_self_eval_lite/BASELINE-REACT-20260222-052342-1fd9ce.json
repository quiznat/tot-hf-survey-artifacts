    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [7, 2, 4, 5] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 7542, which suggests that 7542 might be the correct answer, but we need to verify if it's divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum of digits = 7+2+4+5 = 18, which is divisible by 3, so any permutation will satisfy divisibility by 3. For divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even: only",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [7, 2, 4, 5] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is 7542, which is the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending: 7,5,4,2 \u2192 7542). We need to verify if 7542 is divisible by 6. As noted: sum of digits = 7+2+4+5 = 18, divisible by 3 \u2192 satisfies divisibility by 3. For divisibility by 2, last digit must be even. 7542 ends in 2 \u2192 even \u2192 divisible by 2. So 7542 is divisible by both 2 and 3 \u2192 divisible by 6. Therefore, 7542 is a valid answer. To be thorough, we",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The largest permutation of digits [7,2,4,5] is 7542. Sum of digits = 18, divisible by 3. Last digit is 2 (even), so divisible by 2. Hence, 7542 is divisible by 6.
