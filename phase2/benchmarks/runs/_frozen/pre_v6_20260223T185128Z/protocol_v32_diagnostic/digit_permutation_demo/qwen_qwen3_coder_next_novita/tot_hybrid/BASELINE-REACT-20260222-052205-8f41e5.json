    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [2, 2, 2, 5] (i.e., using all digits exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 5222, which suggests the maximum possible number from those digits is 5222 (since digits sorted descending: 5,2,2,2 \u2192 5222). We need to find the largest permutation \u2264 5222 that is divisible by 7.\n\nWe have two tools:\n- `is_divisible(n, divisor)` \u2014 checks if n is divisible by divisor.\n- `best_divisible(digits, divisor)` \u2014 likely returns the largest number formed by permuting digits divisible by divisor.\n\nBut since the task is to solve using ReAct loop, and we have the digits and divisor, we can try to use `",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number formed by permuting digits [2,2,2,5] (i.e., all permutations of these digits) that is divisible by 7. The maximum possible number from these digits is 5222 (since digits sorted descending: 5,2,2,2). The oracle_max = 5222 confirms this is the upper bound. We need to check permutations in descending order until we find one divisible by 7. Since we have a tool `best_divisible(digits, divisor)`, and it's designed exactly for this purpose (find largest number from digits divisible by divisor), we should use it directly. Let's call `best_divisible([2,2,2,5], 7)`.\nACTION: best_divisible [2, 2, 2, 5] 7",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The tool `best_divisible([2, 2, 2, 5], 7)` returned 5222. Now we need to verify if 5222 is indeed divisible by 7. Since we have the `is_divisible` tool, we should use it to confirm divisibility before finalizing the answer. Let's check `is_divisible(5222, 7)`.\nACTION: is_divisible 5222 7\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: True\nTHINK: The result of `is_divisible(5222, 7)` is True, confirming that 5222 is divisible by 7. Since 5222 is the largest possible permutation of the digits [2,2,2,5] (as confirmed by oracle_max), and it is divisible by 7, it must be the correct answer",
