    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is 9444, which is the largest possible number with those digits (since digits sorted descending: 9, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 9444). We need to check divisibility by 6, which requires divisibility by both 2 and 3.\n\nDivisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 4 (only even digit available; we have three 4s).\n\nDivisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 4 + 4 + 9 + 4 = 21, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 any permutation is divisible by 3.\n\nSo the",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: So far, we've established that any permutation of the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] is divisible by 3 (since digit sum = 21), and to be divisible by 2, the number must end in 4 (the only even digit). Therefore, the largest possible number ending in 4 is formed by placing the remaining digits [9, 4, 4] in descending order before the final 4 \u2192 9444. Since 9444 ends in 4 (even) and sum = 21 (divisible by 3), it is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is 9444, and it satisfies the condition. So the answer is 9444. Let's verify with the is_divisible tool to be safe.",
