    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 9852. Let\u2019s recall the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. So we need to check permutations of the digits, but since we want the maximum, we should try descending order first.\n\nThe digits sorted descending: 9, 8, 5, 2 \u2192 9852. Let\u2019s check if 9852 is divisible by 4. Last two digits: 52. 52 \u00f7 4 = 13 \u2192 yes, divisible. So 9852 is divisible by 4.

Using the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 iff its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits of 9852 are 52, and 52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so it is divisible. Since 9852 is the largest possible arrangement and satisfies divisibility, it must be the answer. The oracle_max being 9852 confirms this is the target. No further checks needed.",
