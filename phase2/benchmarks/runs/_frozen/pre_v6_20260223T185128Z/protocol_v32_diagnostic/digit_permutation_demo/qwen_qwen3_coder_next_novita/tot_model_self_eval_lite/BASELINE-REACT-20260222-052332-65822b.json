    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 1] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9104. Let's verify if 9104 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 9104, last three digits are 104. 104 \u00f7 8 = 13, so yes, 104 is divisible by 8. So 9104 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle says 9104 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9104. But to be thorough, maybe I should confirm using the tools. Let's use `is",
