    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 5, 2, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 8325. Let\u2019s verify if 8325 is divisible by 5: numbers divisible by 5 end in 0 or 5. 8325 ends in 5, so it\u2019s divisible by 5. Now check if 8325 uses exactly the digits [8, 5, 2, 3] \u2014 yes: digits are 8, 3, 2, 5. So 8325 is a valid candidate. Since it's the oracle_max, it's presumably the maximum such number. But to be thorough, let\u2019s confirm using tools: first, check if 8325 is divisible",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 8325, and we suspect it's the correct answer. To confirm, we need to verify two things: (1) 8325 uses exactly the digits [8, 5, 2, 3] \u2014 yes (8, 3, 2, 5), and (2) it's divisible by 5 \u2014 yes, since it ends in 5. However, per the ReAct loop, we should use the available tools to verify divisibility. The tool `is_divisible` likely takes a number and a divisor. So we should call `is_divisible(8325, 5)` to confirm.\nACTION: is_divisible 8325 5",
