    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 1, 5, 6] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 6531, which suggests that 6531 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and likely divisible by 7). Let's verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, I should check if 6531 is divisible by 7 using the `is_divisible` tool. If yes, that's the answer. If not, I'll need to try smaller permutations.\n\nBut before that, note: `best_divisible` is likely a tool that directly returns the largest number formed from the digits divisible by the divisor \u2014 so maybe I can just call that directly. However, to be safe and follow ReAct, I'll reason step-by-step.\n\nLet\u2019s try `",
