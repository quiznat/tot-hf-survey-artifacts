    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle_max is 6312 (which suggests the maximum possible number from those digits is 6321, but 6312 is given as a reference). We need to use the tools best_divisible or is_divisible to find the answer.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.\n\nWe want the largest possible number, so we should try permutations in descending order.\n\nThe digits are [3, 1, 6, 2]. Sorted descending: [6, 3, 2, 1] \u2192 6321.\n\nCheck if 6321 is divisible",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number formed by permuting digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max is 6312, which is less than the maximum permutation 6321 \u2014 suggesting 6321 is not divisible by 4, and perhaps 6312 is the correct answer (or close). Let\u2019s verify using the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 iff its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nWe should try permutations in descending order and check divisibility using `is_divisible`.\n\nStart with the largest permutation: 6321 \u2192 last two digits = 21 \u2192 21 mod 4 = 1 \u2192 not divisible. Next, try 6312 \u2192 last two digits = 12 \u2192 12 mod 4",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The divisibility rule for 4 says a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 6312, the last two digits are 12, and 12 \u00f7 4 = 3, so 12 is divisible by 4. Since 6312 is given as oracle_max and is a permutation of [3,1,6,2], and it's divisible by 4, it's a strong candidate for the answer. We should verify using the `is_divisible` tool to confirm.\nACTION: is_divisible 6312",
