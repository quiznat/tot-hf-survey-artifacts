    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 2, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 11, and the oracle says the maximum possible such number is 9625. Let's verify if 9625 is divisible by 11. To check divisibility by 11, we compute the alternating sum of its digits: (9 + 2) - (6 + 5) = 11 - 11 = 0, which is divisible by 11, so 9625 is divisible by 11. Also, 9625 uses digits 9, 6, 2, 5 \u2014 exactly the given digits. So 9625 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, we",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum is 9625, and we verified that 9625 uses the digits [6, 9, 2, 5] exactly once and is divisible by 11 (alternating sum = 0). Since it's valid and matches the oracle's claim, and no larger permutation of these digits exists (9625 is the largest possible arrangement: 9 > 6 > 5 > 2), we can conclude 9625 is the answer. No further tool calls needed.\nFINAL: 9625"
