    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [3, 1, 5, 6] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 6531, which suggests that 6531 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible candidate that satisfies the condition). Let's verify:  \n- Digits of 6531: 6, 5, 3, 1 \u2014 matches the given digits [3, 1, 5, 6].  \n- Check divisibility by 7: 6531 \u00f7 7 = 933 exactly? Let's compute: 7 \u00d7 933 = 6531 (since 7\u00d7900=6300, 7\u00d733=231, 63",
