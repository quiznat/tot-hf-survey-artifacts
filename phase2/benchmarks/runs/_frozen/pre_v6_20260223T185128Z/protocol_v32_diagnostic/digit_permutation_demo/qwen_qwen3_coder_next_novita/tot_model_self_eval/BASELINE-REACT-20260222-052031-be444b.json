    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 1] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9104. Let's verify if 9104 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 9104, last three digits are 104. 104 \u00f7 8 = 13, so yes, 104 is divisible by 8. So 9104 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle says 9104 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9104. But to be thorough, maybe I should confirm using the tools. Let's use is_div",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible number is 9104. I need to verify if 9104 is divisible by 8 using the available tools. Since the last three digits of 9104 are 104, and 104 \u00f7 8 = 13 (integer), it should be divisible. But to follow the ReAct protocol, I should use the is_divisible tool to confirm. The tool likely takes the number and divisor as input. So I'll call is_divisible with 9104 and 8.\nACTION: is_divisible 9104 8",
