    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is given as 4312, which suggests that 4312 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and divisible by 8). Let's verify:  \n- A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.  \n- For 4312, last three digits = 312.  \n- 312 \u00f7 8 = 39 \u2192 exact division, so 312 is divisible by 8 \u2192 4312 is divisible by 8.  \nAlso, 4312 is the largest permutation of [4,1,2,3",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 4312, and we verified that 4312 is divisible by 8 (since 312 \u00f7 8 = 39). Also, 4312 is the largest possible permutation of digits [4,1,2,3] (since digits sorted descending are [4,3,2,1], and 4312 is the largest permutation \u2264 4321 that satisfies the divisibility condition). To confirm this is indeed the maximum, we should check if any larger permutation exists \u2014 but 4321 is the absolute largest permutation, and we should verify if it's divisible by 8. If not, then 4312 is the next candidate. Let's use the is_divisible tool to verify 4321.\nACTION: is_divisible 4321",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Since 4321 is not divisible by 8, and 4312 is the next largest permutation (and we already verified it is divisible by 8), 4312 is indeed the maximum permutation of [4,1,2,3] divisible by 8. To be thorough, we could confirm using best_divisible, but given the oracle_max matches and our reasoning holds, we can conclude the answer is 4312. However, to strictly follow the ReAct loop and ensure correctness, let's use best_divisible with the given digits and divisor to get the maximum divisible number directly.\nACTION: best_divisible [4,1,2,3] 8",
