    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 0, 7, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum is 9750. Let's verify if 9750 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisible by 2: last digit is 0 \u2192 yes.\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits = 9 + 7 + 5 + 0 = 21 \u2192 21 is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo 9750 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9750. But to be thorough, maybe I should confirm using the tools.",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum is 9750. I verified that 9750 uses all digits [9,0,7,5] exactly once, ends in 0 (so divisible by 2), and digit sum is 21 (divisible by 3), hence divisible by 6. To be rigorous per the ReAct protocol, I should confirm using the `is_divisible` tool before concluding.\nACTION: is_divisible 9750 6",
