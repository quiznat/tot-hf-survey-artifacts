    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [7, 1, 6, 5] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 7651, which suggests that the maximum possible number from those digits is 7651 (since digits sorted descending are 7,6,5,1 \u2192 7651). We need to find the largest permutation \u2264 7651 that is divisible by 7.\n\nWe have two tools:\n- `is_divisible(n, divisor)` \u2014 checks if n is divisible by divisor.\n- `best_divisible(digits, divisor)` \u2014 likely returns the largest number formed by permuting digits divisible by divisor.\n\nSince `best_divisible` directly addresses the task, and we have the digits and divisor, we should call `best_divisible([7,1,6,5],",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number formed by permuting digits [7, 1, 6, 5] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max = 7651 confirms the maximum possible permutation is 7651. Since we have a direct tool `best_divisible(digits, divisor)` that should return the desired result, we should use it. However, the tool input format is unclear \u2014 likely expects digits as a list and divisor as integer. Let's proceed with calling `best_divisible([7,1,6,5], 7)`. But wait \u2014 the instruction says to respond using one of the three forms, and we haven't executed any action yet. Since the tool is available and directly applicable, ACTION is appropriate. Let's assume the tool accepts digits list and divisor.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [7, 1, 6, 5] 7",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The tool `best_divisible([7, 1, 6, 5], 7)` returned 7651. Now we need to verify if 7651 is indeed divisible by 7, since the oracle_max is 7651 but it may not be divisible by 7 \u2014 the tool might have returned the max permutation regardless, or perhaps it did check divisibility. Let's double-check using `is_divisible(7651, 7)`. If it's divisible, then 7651 is the answer. If not, we need to find the next lower valid permutation.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 7651 7",
