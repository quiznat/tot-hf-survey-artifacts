    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 6312. Let\u2019s recall: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. So we should consider permutations of the digits, sort them descendingly, and check divisibility by 4. The largest possible number from digits [3,1,6,2] is 6321. But we need divisible by 4. Let\u2019s list descending permutations and check last two digits:\n\n- 6321 \u2192 last two digits = 21 \u2192 21 mod 4 = 1 \u2192 not divisible\n- 6312 \u2192 last two digits = 12 \u2192 12 mod 4 =",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: 12 mod 4 = 0, so 6312 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle_max is given as 6312, and it matches a valid permutation that is divisible by 4, and it's the largest such number (as it's the second-highest permutation after 6321, which fails), we can conclude 6312 is the answer. Let\u2019s verify using the tools to be thorough. We should use `is_divisible` to confirm 6312 is divisible by 4, and possibly `best_divisible` if needed \u2014 but since oracle_max is provided and matches, and we\u2019ve reasoned it's valid, we can finalize. However, to follow ReAct rigor, we should confirm with a tool call. Let\u2019s call `is_divisible` with number 6312 and divisor 4.",
