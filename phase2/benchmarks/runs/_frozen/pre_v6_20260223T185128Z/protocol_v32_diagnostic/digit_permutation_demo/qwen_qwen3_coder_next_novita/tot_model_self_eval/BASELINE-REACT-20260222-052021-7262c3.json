    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 4319, which suggests that 4319 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible number using those digits and is divisible by 7). Let's verify:  \n- Digits of 4319 are 4, 3, 1, 9 \u2014 matches the input digits.  \n- Check divisibility by 7: 4319 \u00f7 7 = 617 exactly? Let's compute: 7 \u00d7 617 = 4319 (since 7\u00d7600=4200, 7\u00d717=119, 4",
