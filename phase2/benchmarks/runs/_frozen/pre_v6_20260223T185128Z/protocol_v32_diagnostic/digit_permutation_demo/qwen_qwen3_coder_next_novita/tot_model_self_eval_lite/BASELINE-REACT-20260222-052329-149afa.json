    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 4, and we are told the oracle_max is 5360. Let's verify if 5360 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 5360, last two digits are 60, and 60 \u00f7 4 = 15 \u2192 divisible. So 5360 is divisible by 4. Now, can we form 5360 using digits [5,6,0,3]? Yes: digits are 5,3,6,0 \u2014 matches exactly. So 5360 is a valid candidate. Since it's the oracle_max, it's likely",
