    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [2, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6525. Let's verify if 6525 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 6525 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, 6525 uses digits 6, 5, 2, 5 \u2014 which matches the multiset [2, 5, 6, 5]. So 6525 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's divisible by 5, it's likely the answer. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools. Let's use",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle claims the maximum valid number is 6525. We need to verify it using the available tools. First, check if 6525 is divisible by 5 using `is_divisible`. If yes, then confirm it's the largest possible by checking if any larger permutation (e.g., 6552, 6255, etc.) is divisible by 5 \u2014 but since 6525 ends in 5 and is the largest permutation ending in 5 (the only possible ending for divisibility by 5, as no 0 is present), it's likely optimal. However, to be rigorous, we should use `best_divisible` if it can directly return the maximum divisible number, or use `is_divisible` to validate candidates. Let's start by verifying 6525.\nACTION: is_divisible 6525 5",
