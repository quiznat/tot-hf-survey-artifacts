    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 5, 6, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle_max is 5536, which suggests the maximum possible number is 5536. Let's first check if 5536 is divisible by 8. If not, we need to find the next lower number formed by permuting the digits that is divisible by 8.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet\u2019s check 5536: last three digits are 536. Is 536 divisible by 8? 536 \u00f7 8 = 67 \u2192 yes, since 8 \u00d7 67 = 5",
