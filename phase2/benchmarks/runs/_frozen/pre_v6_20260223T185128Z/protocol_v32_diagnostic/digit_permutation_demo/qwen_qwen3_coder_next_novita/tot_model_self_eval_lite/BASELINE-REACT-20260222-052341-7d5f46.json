    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by permuting the digits [2, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum is 6525. Let's verify if 6525 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 6525 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, 6525 uses digits 6, 5, 2, 5 \u2014 which matches the multiset of given digits [2, 5, 6, 5]. Since the oracle says 6525 is the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 6525. But to follow the ReAct loop, I should confirm using the tools if needed. Let's",
