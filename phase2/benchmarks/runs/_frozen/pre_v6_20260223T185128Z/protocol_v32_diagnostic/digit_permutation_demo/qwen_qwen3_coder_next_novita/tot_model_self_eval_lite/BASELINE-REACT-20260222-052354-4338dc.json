    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 2, 0, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 8204, which suggests that 8204 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible such number). Let's verify:  \n- Digits of 8204 are [8, 2, 0, 4] \u2014 matches the given digits.  \n- Check divisibility by 7: 8204 \u00f7 7 = 1172 exactly? Let's compute: 7 \u00d7 1172 = 8204 (since 7\u00d71100=7700, 7\u00d772=504, 7700+504=820",
