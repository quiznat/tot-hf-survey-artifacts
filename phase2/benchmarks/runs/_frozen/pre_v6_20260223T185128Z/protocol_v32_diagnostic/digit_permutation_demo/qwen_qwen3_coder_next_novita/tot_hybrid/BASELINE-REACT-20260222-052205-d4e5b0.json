    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (8) using the digits [0, 4, 9, 8] exactly once each. The oracle_max is 9840, which suggests that 9840 is the correct answer (since it's the largest possible permutation of those digits and divisible by 8). Let's verify:  \n- Digits: 0, 4, 9, 8 \u2192 permutations include 9840, 9804, 9480, etc.  \n- Check divisibility by 8: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.  \n- For 9840: last three digits = 840 \u2192 840 \u00f7 8 = 105 \u2192 divisible.  \nSo 9840 is divisible",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 9840, and we verified that 9840 uses all digits [0,4,9,8] exactly once and is divisible by 8 (since 840 \u00f7 8 = 105). Since 9840 is the largest possible permutation of those digits (9 > 8 > 4 > 0), and it satisfies the divisibility condition, it must be the maximum divisible number. We can confirm using the is_divisible tool to be thorough, but given the oracle_max and our reasoning, it's highly likely correct. Let's verify divisibility directly with the tool to be safe.\nACTION: is_divisible 9840",
