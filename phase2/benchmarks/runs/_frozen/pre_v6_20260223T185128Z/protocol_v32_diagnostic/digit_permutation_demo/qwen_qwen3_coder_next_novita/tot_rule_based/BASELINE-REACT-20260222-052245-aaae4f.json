    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 3, 8, 8] that is divisible by 6, and we are told the oracle_max is 8538. Let's recall: a number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 8, 8 (only even digits available are 8s).  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 any permutation will satisfy divisibility by 3.  \nSo we only need to ensure the number ends in 8 (even), and is as large as possible.  \nTo maximize the",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: To maximize the number, we want the largest possible digits in the highest place values, with the constraint that the last digit must be 8 (to ensure evenness). Since we have two 8s, we can use one as the last digit and place the other 8 in the thousands place if possible. The remaining digits are 5 and 3. Sorting descending: [8, 5, 3, 8] \u2192 8538. That matches the oracle_max, and since 8538 ends in 8 (even) and digit sum = 24 (divisible by 3), it's divisible by 6. So 8538 is the answer. Let's verify with the tools to be safe. First, check if 8538 is divisible by 6 using is_divisible.",
