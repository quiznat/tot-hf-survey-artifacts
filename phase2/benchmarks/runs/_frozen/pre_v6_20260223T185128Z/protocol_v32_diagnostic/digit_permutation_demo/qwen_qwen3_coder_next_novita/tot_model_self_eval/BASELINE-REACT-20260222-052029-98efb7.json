    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 3, 2, 1] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max is given as 4312, which suggests that 4312 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and divisible by 11). Let's verify:  \n- 4312 \u00f7 11 = 392, and 11 \u00d7 392 = 4312 \u2192 yes, divisible.  \n- Is 4312 the largest permutation? The digits sorted descending are [4,3,2,1] \u2192 4321.

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 4312, which is a candidate. We need to verify if it's indeed the largest permutation of [4,3,2,1] divisible by 11. The permutations in descending order start with 4321, then 4312. Let's check 4321 first using is_divisible. If not divisible, then 4312 is next \u2014 and if divisible, and matches oracle_max, it's likely correct. But to be thorough, we should confirm divisibility of 4321 first.  \nACTION: is_divisible 4321",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Since 4321 is not divisible by 11, the next largest permutation is 4312. The oracle_max is given as 4312, and we already verified that 4312 \u00f7 11 = 392 (exact), so it is divisible. To be thorough, we should confirm using the is_divisible tool that 4312 is divisible by 11. If so, and since it's the next largest after 4321, it must be the answer.  \nACTION: is_divisible 4312",
