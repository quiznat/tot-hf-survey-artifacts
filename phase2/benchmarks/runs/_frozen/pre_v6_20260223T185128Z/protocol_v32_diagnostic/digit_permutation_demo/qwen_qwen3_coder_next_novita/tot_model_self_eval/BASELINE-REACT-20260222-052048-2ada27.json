    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number \u2264 9023 that can be formed using the digits [0, 9, 2, 3] (each used at most once) and is divisible by 7. We have two tools: `is_divisible(n, d)` to check divisibility, and `best_divisible(digits, divisor, max_val)` which likely solves the problem directly. Since `best_divisible` is available and likely implements an optimized search, and the input matches its expected signature (digits, divisor, max_val), the best approach is to call it directly. Let's use `best_divisible([0,9,2,3], 7, 9023)`.\nACTION: best_divisible [0, 9, 2, 3] 7 9023",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 9023",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The tool `best_divisible` returned 9023. Now I need to verify whether 9023 is indeed divisible by 7, since the task requires the number to be divisible by the divisor (7). Let's check using `is_divisible(9023, 7)`. If it's divisible, then 9023 is the answer. If not, I need to find the next lower valid number formed from the digits [0,9,2,3] that is divisible by 7.\nACTION: is_divisible 9023 7",
