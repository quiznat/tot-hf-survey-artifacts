    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 3, 8, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 8538. Since 8538 is the maximum possible number from those digits (digits sorted descending: 8, 8, 5, 3 \u2192 8853, but 8538 is given as oracle_max, so perhaps it's the largest *divisible* candidate), we should first check if 8538 is divisible by 6. If yes, that\u2019s the answer. If not, we need to find the next lower permutation divisible by 6.\n\nRecall: A number is divisible by 6 iff it\u2019s divisible by both 2 and 3.\n- Divisible by 2 \u2192 last digit even \u2192 must",

From digits [5, 3, 8, 8], the even digits are 8 and 8, so last digit must be 8.  \n- Divisible by 3 \u2192 sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 all permutations are divisible by 3. So only need to ensure last digit is 8.  \n\nNow, to get the largest possible number ending in 8, we want the remaining digits [5, 3, 8] in descending order: 8, 5, 3 \u2192 so candidate = 8538.

    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: We need to verify if 8538 is divisible by 6. Since the sum of digits is 24 (divisible by 3) and the last digit is 8 (even), 8538 is divisible by both 2 and 3, hence by 6. It's also the largest permutation ending in 8 (remaining digits [8,5,3] in descending order), and matches the oracle_max. So 8538 is the correct answer.\nFINAL: 8538"
