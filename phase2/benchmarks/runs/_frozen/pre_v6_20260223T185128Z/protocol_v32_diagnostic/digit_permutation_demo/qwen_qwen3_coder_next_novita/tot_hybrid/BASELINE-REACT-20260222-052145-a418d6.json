    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 8, 1, 6] that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 5816. Let's verify if 5816 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 5816, the last three digits are 816. Check if 816 \u00f7 8 is integer: 8 \u00d7 102 = 816, so yes, 816 is divisible by 8, so 5816 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle says 5816 is the maximum, and it's divisible by 8, then 5816 is the answer. Let's confirm using",
