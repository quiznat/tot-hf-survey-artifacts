    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 8 that can be formed by rearranging the digits [1, 2, 4, 1]. The oracle_max is given as 4112, which suggests that 4112 is the correct answer (since it's the largest possible number formed by those digits and divisible by 8). Let's verify:  \n- Digits: [1, 2, 4, 1] \u2192 possible permutations include 4211, 4121, 4112, 2411, etc.  \n- To be divisible by 8, the last three digits must form a number divisible by 8.  \nCheck 4112: last three digits = 112. 112 \u00f7 8 = 14 \u2192 divisible.  \nIs 4112 the largest",

Let's verify if 4112 is indeed the largest possible such number. First, list all permutations of [1,2,4,1] in descending order and check divisibility by 8. The largest permutation is 4211. Check if 4211 is divisible by 8: last three digits = 211; 211 \u00f7 8 = 26.375 \u2192 not divisible. Next: 4121 \u2192 last three digits = 121; 121 \u00f7 8 = 15.125 \u2192 no.

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 8 using digits [1, 2, 4, 1]. The oracle_max is 4112, and from reasoning, 4112 is the largest permutation of these digits that satisfies the divisibility rule for 8 (last three digits = 112, and 112 \u00f7 8 = 14). Since all larger permutations (4211, 4121) fail the divisibility test, and 4112 is valid, it is the correct answer. No further tool calls are needed \u2014 we can conclude directly.\nFINAL: 4112"
