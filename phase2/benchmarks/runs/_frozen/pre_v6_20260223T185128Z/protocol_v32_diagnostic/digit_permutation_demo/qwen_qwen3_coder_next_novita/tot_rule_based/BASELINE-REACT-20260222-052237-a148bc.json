    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 6, 0] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6300. Let's verify if 6300 is achievable and divisible by 6.\n\nDigits of 6300 are [6, 3, 0, 0] \u2014 matches our available digits [3, 0, 6, 0] (two zeros, a 3, and a 6). So 6300 is constructible.\n\nNow check divisibility by 6: a number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisible by 2? 6300 ends in 0 \u2192 yes.\n- Divisible by 3?
