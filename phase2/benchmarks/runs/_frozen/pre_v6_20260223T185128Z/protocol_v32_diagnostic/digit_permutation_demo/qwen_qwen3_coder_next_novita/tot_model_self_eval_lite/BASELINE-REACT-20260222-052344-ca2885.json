    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 7] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 7560, which suggests that 7560 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible number formed from those digits and divisible by 7). Let's verify:  \n- Digits of 7560: 7, 5, 6, 0 \u2014 matches the input digits.  \n- Is 7560 divisible by 7? Let's check: 7560 \u00f7 7 = 1080, which is an integer. So yes.  \nSince 7560 is the largest permutation of [5,6,0,7] (since 7650 > 7605",
