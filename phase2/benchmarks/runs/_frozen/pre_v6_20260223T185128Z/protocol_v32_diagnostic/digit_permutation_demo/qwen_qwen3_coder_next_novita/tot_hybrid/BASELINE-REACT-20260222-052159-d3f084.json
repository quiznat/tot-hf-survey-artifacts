    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number \u2264 9023 that can be formed using the digits [0, 9, 2, 3] (each used at most once) and is divisible by 7. We have two tools: `is_divisible(n, d)` to check divisibility, and `best_divisible(digits, divisor, max_val)` which likely directly solves the problem \u2014 but since the benchmark may require using reasoning steps, let's consider using `best_divisible` as the most efficient tool.\n\nGiven that `best_divisible` takes `(digits, divisor, oracle_max)`, and our inputs match exactly: digits = [0, 9, 2, 3], divisor = 7, oracle_max = 9023, we can directly call it.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [0, 9, 2, 3] 7 902",
