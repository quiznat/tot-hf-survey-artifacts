    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [7, 8, 9, 9] that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9978. Let's verify if 9978 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit is 8 \u2192 even \u2192 OK.  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits = 9 + 9 + 7 + 8 = 33 \u2192 33 is divisible by 3 \u2192 OK.  \nSo 9978 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says max is 9978, and it's valid, the answer should be 9978. But to be thorough, maybe I should",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible is 9978. I verified that 9978 is divisible by 6: it's even (ends in 8), and digit sum is 9+9+7+8 = 33, which is divisible by 3. Since 9978 uses the digits [7, 8, 9, 9] exactly and satisfies divisibility by 6, and the oracle confirms it's the maximum, no further checks are needed. I can confirm the answer directly.\nFINAL: 9978"
