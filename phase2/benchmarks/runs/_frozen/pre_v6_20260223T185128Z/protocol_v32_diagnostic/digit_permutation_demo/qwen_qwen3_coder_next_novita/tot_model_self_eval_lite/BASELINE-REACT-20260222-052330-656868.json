    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 3, 8, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 8538. Since 8538 is the maximum possible number from those digits (digits sorted descending: 8, 8, 5, 3 \u2192 8853? Wait \u2014 8538 is given as oracle_max, so perhaps it's the largest *divisible* candidate? Let's verify.\n\nFirst, recall: A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisible by 2 \u2192 last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits from [5,3,8,8] are 8 or 8 (only 8 is even).\n- Divisible by 3 \u2192",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- For divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 only 8 is even in [5,3,8,8], so last digit must be 8.  \n- For divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 all permutations satisfy divisibility by 3. So we only need to enforce last digit = 8, and find the largest such number.\n\nTo maximize the number, we want the largest possible prefix before the final 8. Remaining digits after fixing last digit = 8: [5, 3, 8] \u2192 sort descending: 8, 5, 3 \u2192 number = 8538. That matches oracle",

As established:  \n- Sum of digits = 24 \u2192 divisible by 3, so all permutations satisfy divisibility by 3.  \n- Divisible by 2 requires last digit even \u2192 only 8 is even, so last digit must be 8.  \n- Remaining digits [5, 3, 8] \u2192 largest arrangement is 853, so full number is 8538.  \nThis matches the given oracle_max, confirming it's the correct answer.
