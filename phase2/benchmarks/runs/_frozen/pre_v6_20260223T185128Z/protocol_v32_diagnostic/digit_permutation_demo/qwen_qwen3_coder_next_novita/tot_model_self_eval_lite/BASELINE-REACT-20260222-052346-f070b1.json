    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [3, 5, 6, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum is 5536. Let's verify if 5536 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 5536, the last three digits are 536. Check if 536 \u00f7 8 is integer: 8 \u00d7 67 = 536, so yes, 536 is divisible by 8. So 5536 is divisible by 8. Now, is 5536 the maximum possible? Let's consider permutations of [3,5,6,5] in descending order: possible candidates:",
