    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible such number is 9965. Let's verify if 9965 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 9965 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, the digits of 9965 are [9, 9, 6, 5], which match the given digits [6, 9, 9, 5] (just reordered). So 9965 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it satisfies the divisibility condition, we can conclude that 9965 is",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 9965. We need to verify if 9965 is indeed the largest number formed from digits [6, 9, 9, 5] divisible by 5. As noted, 9965 ends in 5 \u2192 divisible by 5, and uses digits [9,9,6,5] which match the input multiset. To be thorough, we should confirm no larger permutation (e.g., 9995 or 9965 is already the largest possible arrangement with 5 at the end \u2014 since digits sorted descending are [9,9,6,5], and only numbers ending in 5 are divisible by 5 (no 0), so 9965 is indeed the maximum possible. Let\u2019s use is_divisible to double-check 9965 % 5 == 0.\nACTION: is",
