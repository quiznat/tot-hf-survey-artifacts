    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [7, 2, 4, 5] that is divisible by 6, and we\u2019re told the oracle_max is 7542. Let\u2019s recall: a number is divisible by 6 iff it\u2019s divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2 \u21d2 last digit must be even \u21d2 from digits, only 2 is even, so last digit must be 2.  \n- Divisible by 3 \u21d2 sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 7+2+4+5 = 18, which is divisible by 3 \u21d2 any permutation is divisible by 3. So only need to ensure last digit is 2.  \nSo we want the largest permutation ending in 2. Remaining digits: [7,4,5] \u2192 sort descending: 7",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From STEP 1, we deduced that for divisibility by 6, the number must end in 2 (only even digit), and since digit sum is 18 (divisible by 3), any arrangement ending in 2 is divisible by 6. To maximize the number, we want the largest possible prefix before the final 2. Remaining digits are [7,4,5]; sorted descending gives 754. So candidate is 7542. The oracle_max is 7542, which matches \u2014 likely the correct answer. But to be rigorous, we should verify using the tools: first check if 7542 is divisible by 6 using is_divisible, or directly use best_divisible if available. Since best_divisible is a tool, and the task likely expects using it, let\u2019s invoke best_divisible with digits and divisor.",
