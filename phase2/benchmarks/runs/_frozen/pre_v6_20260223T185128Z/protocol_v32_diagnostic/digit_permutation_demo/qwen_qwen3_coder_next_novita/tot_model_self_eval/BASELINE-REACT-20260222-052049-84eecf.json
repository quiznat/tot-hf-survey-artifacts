    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9965. Let's verify and reason.\n\nA number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5. Among the given digits [6, 9, 9, 5], only 5 can serve as the last digit (no 0 available). So the number must end in 5.\n\nWe want the largest such number, so we want the remaining digits [6, 9, 9] arranged in descending order before the 5: that gives 9965.\n\nNow check: is 9965 divisible by 5? Yes, because it ends in 5.\n\nWe can confirm using the `is_divisible",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number formed by permuting digits [6, 9, 9, 5] that is divisible by 5. Since divisibility by 5 requires the last digit to be 0 or 5, and only 5 is available (no 0), the number must end in 5. To maximize the number, arrange the remaining digits [6, 9, 9] in descending order: 9965. The oracle says 9965 is the maximum, and it ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5. Let's verify with `is_divisible`.\nACTION: is_divisible 9965 5",
