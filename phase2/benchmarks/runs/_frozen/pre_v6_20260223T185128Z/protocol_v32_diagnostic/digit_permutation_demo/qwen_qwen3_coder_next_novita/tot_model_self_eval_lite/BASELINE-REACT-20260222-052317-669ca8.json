    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 8 that can be formed by rearranging the digits [1, 2, 4, 1]. The oracle_max is given as 4112, which suggests that 4112 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible number formed from those digits and is divisible by 8). Let's verify:  \n- Digits: [1, 2, 4, 1] \u2192 possible permutations include 4112, 4121, 4211, 2411, etc.  \n- 4112 is the largest permutation (since digits sorted descending: [4,2,1,1] \u2192 4211, but 4211 vs 4112: 4211 > 4112, so why oracle_max",
