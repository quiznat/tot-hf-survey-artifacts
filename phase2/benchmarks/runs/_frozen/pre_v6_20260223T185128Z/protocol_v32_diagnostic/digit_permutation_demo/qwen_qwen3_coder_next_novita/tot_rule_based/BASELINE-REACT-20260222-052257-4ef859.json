    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 7] that is divisible by 7, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 7560. Let's verify if 7560 is divisible by 7. If yes, and uses all digits, then it's the answer. Check: 7560 \u00f7 7 = 1080, which is integer, so yes. Digits of 7560 are [7,5,6,0] \u2014 matches given digits. So 7560 is valid. Since oracle_max is 7560, and it's divisible, that must be the answer. But to be thorough, maybe confirm using tools. Let's use is_divisible on 7560 with divisor 7.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 7",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: yes",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 7560, and we just confirmed that 7560 is divisible by 7 using the is_divisible tool. Also, 7560 uses exactly the digits [5, 6, 0, 7] (as [7,5,6,0]). Since the oracle guarantees 7560 is the maximum possible such number, and it satisfies all conditions, we can conclude the answer is 7560.\n\nFINAL: 7560"
