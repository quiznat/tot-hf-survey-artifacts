    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed by permuting the digits [1, 2, 4, 1] and is divisible by 8, with the oracle_max given as 4112. Since the oracle_max is 4112, and the digits are [1,2,4,1], the maximum possible permutation is 4211, but 4112 is less than that, so perhaps 4112 is the largest valid permutation divisible by 8. Let's verify if 4112 is divisible by 8 using the is_divisible tool. If yes, and it's formed from the digits, then it's the answer. If not, we need to search for the next lower permutation divisible by 8.\n\nFirst, check if 4112 is divisible by 8.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The is_divisible tool returned \"no\" for input 4, but that seems inconsistent \u2014 likely the tool expects the number itself as input, not the divisor. Let me re-evaluate: the tool `is_divisible` probably takes a number and checks if it's divisible by the given divisor (8). So I should call `is_divisible 4112`. Let me try that.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4112",
