    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and we are told the oracle_max is 9444. Since 9444 is the maximum possible number with those digits (digits sorted descending: 9, 4, 4, 4), we should first check if 9444 is divisible by 6. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisible by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 last digit must be 4 (only even digit available).\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 4+4+9+4 =",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 4 + 4 + 9 + 4 = 21, which is divisible by 3. So divisibility by 3 is satisfied for any permutation. For divisibility by 2, the last digit must be even \u2014 the only even digit available is 4, so the number must end in 4. The maximum possible number is 9444, which ends in 4, so it satisfies the even condition. Since sum = 21 is divisible by 3, and last digit is 4 (even), 9444 is divisible by 6. Let's verify using the is_divisible tool.",
