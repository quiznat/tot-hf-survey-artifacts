    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum is 9965. Let's verify if 9965 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 9965 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, 9965 uses digits 9, 9, 6, 5 \u2014 exactly the given digits. So 9965 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9965. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools. Let's use `is_divisible` to verify 9",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum is 9965. I need to verify it using the available tools. First, check if 9965 is divisible by 5 using `is_divisible`. The number 9965 ends in 5, so it should be divisible by 5, but I should confirm via the tool. Also, ensure it uses the exact digits [6, 9, 9, 5] \u2014 it does (9,9,6,5). Since the oracle says it's the maximum and it's valid, the answer is likely 9965, but I should verify divisibility to be rigorous.\nACTION: is_divisible 9965 5",
