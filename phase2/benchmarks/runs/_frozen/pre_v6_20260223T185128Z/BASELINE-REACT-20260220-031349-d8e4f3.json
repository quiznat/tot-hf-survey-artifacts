    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to use the numbers [4, 4, 10, 10] to reach a target value, likely 24 (common in 24 game puzzles), using arithmetic operations.

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a way to combine [4, 4, 10, 10] to reach 24. Let me try more structured approaches. Common strategies include factoring 24: 24 = 6\u00d74, 8\u00d73, 12\u00d72, etc. With two 10s and two 4s, maybe (10 + 10 + 4) = 24, but that's only three numbers \u2014 need to use all four. So must incorporate the fourth 4 in a neutral way, like \u00d71 or +0. For example: (10 + 10 + 4) \u00d7 (4/4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24. That uses all four numbers! Let me verify: 4/4 = 1, 10+10+4 = 24",
