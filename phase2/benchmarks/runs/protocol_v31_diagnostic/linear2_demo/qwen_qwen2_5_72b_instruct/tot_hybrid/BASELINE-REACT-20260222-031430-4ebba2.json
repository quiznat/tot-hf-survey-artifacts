    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task involves solving a system of linear equations. Each equation is represented as [a, b, c] for the form ax + by = c. The available tools include `solve2`, which seems to be designed for solving a system of two linear equations, and `check_xy`, which might be used to verify the solution. I will use the `solve2` tool first to find the values of x and y.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-5, 6, 33], [-4, -7, 50]]",

To ensure this solution is correct, I should now use the `check_xy` tool with these values.\n\nACTION: check_xy [[-5, 6, 33], [-4, -7, 50]], [-9, -2]\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: The solution satisfies both equations.\nFINAL: The solution to the system of equations is x = -9 and y = -2."
