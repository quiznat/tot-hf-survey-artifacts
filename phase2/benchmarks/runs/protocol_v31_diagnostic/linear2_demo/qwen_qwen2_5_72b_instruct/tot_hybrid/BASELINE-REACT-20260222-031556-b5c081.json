    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to solve a system of linear equations. The input is in the form of a list of lists, where each inner list represents an equation in the form [a, b, c] corresponding to the equation ax + by = c. I need to use the available tools to find the values of x and y.\n\nThe available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`.
