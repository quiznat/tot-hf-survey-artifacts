    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to solve a system of linear equations represented in matrix form, where the first list represents coefficients of x and y and the last element is the constant for each equation. We have two tools available: `check_xy` which I assume can verify if a solution (x, y) satisfies the equations, and `solve2` which I believe will solve the system of equations directly. Since we don't yet have a solution to check, the logical first step would be to use `solve2` to find the values of x and y.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-2, 5, 3, 8, 2, -34]",
