The given equations can be represented as:\n1) -x + 2y = -15\n2) 3x - 5y = 41\n\nI have two available tools: `check_xy` and `solve2`. The `solve2` tool appears to be the appropriate choice for solving a system of two linear equations with two variables. I will provide the coefficients of x and y, along with the constants from the right-hand side of the equations to the `solve2` tool.\n\nACTION: solve2 -1 2 -15 3 -5 41",
