    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task involves solving a system of linear equations. The input is in the form of two equations represented as arrays where the first two elements are coefficients and the third element is the constant term. I need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The available tools are `check_xy` which likely checks if a pair (x, y) satisfies the equations and `solve2` which seems designed to solve systems of two linear equations. I will start by using `solve2` to find the solution.\n\nACTION: solve2 [7, 1, 51] [-7, -3, -69]",
