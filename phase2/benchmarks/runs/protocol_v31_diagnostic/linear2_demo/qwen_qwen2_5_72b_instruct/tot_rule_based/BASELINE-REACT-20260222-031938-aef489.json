    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve the system of linear equations represented by the matrix. Each row in the matrix represents an equation in the form of ax + by = c. The given equations are 6x + 3y = -21 and 0x + 5y = -15. Since the second equation already has a coefficient of 0 for x, we can directly solve it for y. Once we have y, we can substitute it into the first equation to find x.\n\nACTION: solve2 6, 3, -21, 0, 5, -15",
