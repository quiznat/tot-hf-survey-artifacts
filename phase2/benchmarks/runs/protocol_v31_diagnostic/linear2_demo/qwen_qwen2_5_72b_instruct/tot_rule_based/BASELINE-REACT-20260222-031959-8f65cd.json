The available tools `check_xy` and `solve2` suggest that `solve2` is likely the one to use for finding the solution to the system of equations, while `check_xy` might be used to verify the solution. First, I should use `solve2` with the provided coefficients and constants.\n\nACTION: solve2 -5 6 33 -4 -7 50",
