    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task input is a set of linear equations in the form of coefficients. Each list represents an equation where the first element is the coefficient of x, the second element is the coefficient of y, and the third element is the constant term. We have two equations here, which means we can solve for the values of x and y using these equations. Since we have a tool called `solve2` which seems appropriate for solving systems of linear equations, I will use that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [3, -4, 24] [-6, 0, 0]",
