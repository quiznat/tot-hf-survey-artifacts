    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what operations are needed.

For [9, 6, 48], maybe it's 9 \u00d7 (something) = 48, or 6 \u00d7 (something) = 48.",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me re-examine the equations more systematically. Looking at [9, 6, 48] and [-7, 5, 40], I need to find a consistent operation or relationship between the first two numbers that produces the third number.\n\nFor [9, 6, 48]:\n- 9 \u00d7 6 = 54 \u2260 48\n- 6 \u00d7 9 = 54 \u2260 48\n- 9 + 6 = 15 \u2260 48\n- 9 - 6 = 3 \u2260 48\n- 6 - 9 = -3 \u2260 48\n- 9 \u00f7 6 = 1.5 \u2260 48\n- 6 \u00f7 9 = 0.67 \u2260 48\n\nWait, let me try: 9 \u00d7 6 - 6 = 5",

Let me check if there's a consistent rule for both equations.\n\nFor [9, 6, 48]: What if it's 9 \u00d7 6 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48? That works!\nFor [-7, 5, 40]: What if it's -7 \u00d7 5 - 5 = -35 - 5 = -40? That doesn't work.\n\nLet me try another approach: 9 \u00d7 6 - 6 = 48, so 9 \u00d7 6 - 6 = 48. This means a \u00d7 b - b = c, or b(a-1) = c.\nCheck: 6(9-1) = 6 \u00d7 8 =",

From my previous analysis, I found that for [9, 6, 48], the pattern b(a-1) = c works: 6(9-1) = 6 \u00d7 8 = 48. \n\nNow let me test this pattern with the second equation [-7, 5, 40]:\nUsing the same formula: b(a-1) = c\n5(-7-1) = 5 \u00d7 (-8) = -40\n\nBut the expected result is 40, not -40.

    "STEP 5 MODEL: THINK: I've used the solve2 tool for the first equation [9, 6, 48] and got x=0.000000, y=8.000000. This suggests that the relationship might be of the form ax + by = c, where a=9, b=6, c=48, and we found x=0, y=8. This means 9(0) + 6(8) = 48, or simply 6\u00d78 = 48.\n\nLet me verify this pattern with the second equation [-7, 5, 40]. If the pattern is similar, I should get values such that -7\u00d7x + 5\u00d7y = 40.\n\nLet me try using solve2 again with the second equation to see what values we get.\nACTION: solve2 {\"a\": -7, \"",
