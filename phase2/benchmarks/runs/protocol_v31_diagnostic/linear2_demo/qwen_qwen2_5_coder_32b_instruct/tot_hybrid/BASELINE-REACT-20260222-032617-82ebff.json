    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables. The equations are:\n1) 9x + 0y = 27\n2) -4x + 4y = -40\n\nI can see that the first equation has a coefficient of 0 for y, which means I can easily solve for x directly. Then I can substitute that value into the second equation to find y.\n\nLet me start by solving the first equation for x.\nACTION: solve2 9 0 27",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I've solved the system of equations and found that x = 3 and y = -7. Let me verify this solution by checking both original equations:\n\nEquation 1: 9x + 0y = 27\nSubstituting x = 3: 9(3) + 0(-7) = 27 + 0 = 27 \u2713\n\nEquation 2: -4x + 4y = -40\nSubstituting x = 3 and y = -7: -4(3) + 4(-7) = -12 + (-28) = -40 \u2713\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so my solution is correct.\n\nFINAL: x = 3, y = -7"
