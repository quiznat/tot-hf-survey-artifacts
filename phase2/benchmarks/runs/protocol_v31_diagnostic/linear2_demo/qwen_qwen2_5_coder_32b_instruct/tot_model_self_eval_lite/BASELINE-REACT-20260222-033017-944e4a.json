    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables. The equations are:\n- Equation 1: -5x + 0y = 25\n- Equation 2: 1x + 2y = -11\n\nI can see that the first equation has a coefficient of 0 for y, which means it's already solved for x. Let me solve this step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1: -5x = 25, so x = -5\nNow I can substitute x = -5 into equation 2 to find y.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the available tools. Since I have a system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns, I should use the solve2 tool.\n\nLet me use the solve2 tool with the given coefficients.\nACTION: solve2 [[-5, 0, 25], [1, 2, -11]]",
