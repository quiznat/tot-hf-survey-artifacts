    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to analyze the given equations and determine what to do next. The equations are presented as pairs of numbers followed by a result, like [-5, -7, -16] and [-9, 8, -70]. This looks like it could be representing systems of linear equations or some other mathematical relationship.\n\nLet me first understand what these represent. If these are equations in the form ax + by = c, then:\n- First equation: -5x + (-7)y = -16 \u2192 -5x - 7y = -16\n- Second equation: -9x + 8y = -70\n\nI should try to solve this system of equations. Since I have two equations with two unknowns (x and y), I can use the solve2 tool which is designed for solving systems of two linear equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-5, -7, -16,",

Let me verify this is correct by checking both original equations:\n\nFirst equation: -5x - 7y = -16\n-5(6) + (-7)(-2) = -30 + 14 = -16 \u2713\n\nSecond equation: -9x + 8y = -70\n-9(6) + 8(-2) = -54 + (-16) = -70 \u2713\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\n\nFINAL: x = 6, y = -2"
