    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task using the available tools. The task provides two equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. I have two tools available: check_xy which can verify if a given x,y pair satisfies the equations, and solve2 which can solve a system of two linear equations. \n\nLooking at the equations:\n- Equation 1: -9x + 7y = 15\n- Equation 2: -2x + 0y = 8\n\nSince the second equation has a coefficient of 0 for y, it simplifies to -2x = 8, so x = -4. This is a simple case that I could solve directly, but I'll use the solve2 tool as it's designed for this purpose.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-9, 7, 15], [-2, 0, 8]]",
