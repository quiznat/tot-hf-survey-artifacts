    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -7x + 3y = 87  \nEquation 2: -6x - 1y = 46  \n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can use the `solve2` tool, which is likely designed to solve systems of two linear equations. Let me try that first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-7, 3, 87], [-6, -1, 46]]",
