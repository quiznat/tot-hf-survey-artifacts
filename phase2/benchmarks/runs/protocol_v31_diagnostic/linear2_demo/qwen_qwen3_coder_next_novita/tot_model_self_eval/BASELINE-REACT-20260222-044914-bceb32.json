    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in two variables, represented as coefficients and constants.

Since we have a tool `solve2`, it likely solves a 2x2 linear system. Let's use that tool directly.\n\nTool input for `solve2` should be the coefficient matrix and constant vector \u2014 likely as a list of equations or a structured input.
