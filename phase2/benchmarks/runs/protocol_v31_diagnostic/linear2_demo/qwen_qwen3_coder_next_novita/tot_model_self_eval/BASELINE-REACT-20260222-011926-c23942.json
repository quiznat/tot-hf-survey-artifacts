    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n-6x - y = -46  \n-7x + 3y = -62  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. If not, I can use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions. First, I\u2019ll try `solve2` with the equations.\n\nThe equations are:  \n1) -6x - y = -46  \n2) -7x + 3y = -62  \n\nI\u2019ll pass the coefficients as a list of lists to `solve2`.",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve the system of linear equations given by coefficients [[-6, -1, -46], [-7, 3, -62]], i.e.,  \n-6x - y = -46  \n-7x + 3y = -62  \n\nI attempted to use `solve2`, but no action was taken \u2014 possibly because the tool expects a different input format or wasn\u2019t invoked correctly. Let me try solving manually or using `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions.  \n\nFirst, solve equation (1) for y:  \n-6x - y = -46 \u2192 y = -6x + 46  \n\nSubstitute into equation (2):  \n-7x + 3(-6x + 46) = -62  \n-7x -18x + 138 = -62  \n-25x = -20",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: From STEP 2, I derived -25x = -20, so x = (-20)/(-25) = 0.8 = 4/5. Then y = -6x + 46 = -6*(4/5) + 46 = -24/5 + 230/5 = 206/5 = 41.2. Let me verify this solution (x = 4/5, y = 206/5) in both equations using `check_xy`. The tool likely expects input as [x, y] or maybe [x_val, y_val]. I'll try `check_xy` with [4/5, 206/5] or decimal approximations [0.8, 41.2]. But to be precise, I'll use fractions: x = 4/5,",
    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: From manual solving, I found x = 4/5 and y = 206/5. Let me verify this using `check_xy`. Since the tool likely expects numerical values, I'll use decimals: x = 0.8, y = 41.2. Alternatively, to avoid floating-point issues, I could use fractions or integers by scaling \u2014 but first, let me try `check_xy` with [0.8, 41.2]. If that fails, I\u2019ll try exact fractions or re-evaluate.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe I made an arithmetic error. Let me double-check the algebra:\n\nEquation 1: -6x - y = -46 \u2192 y = -6x + 46  \nEquation 2: -7x + 3y = -62  \nSubstitute y:  \n-7x + 3(-6x + 46)",
    "STEP 4 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 5 MODEL: THINK: Let me recheck the algebra carefully. From equation 1: -6x - y = -46 \u2192 y = -6x + 46. Substitute into equation 2: -7x + 3(-6x + 46) = -62 \u2192 -7x -18x + 138 = -62 \u2192 -25x = -200 \u2192 x = 8. Ah! I made an arithmetic error earlier: 138 - (-62) = 200, not 20. So -25x = -200 \u2192 x = 8. Then y = -6(8) + 46 = -48 + 46 = -2. So solution is x = 8, y = -2. Let me verify with `check_xy([8, -2])`.\nFINAL: ["
