    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations like a*x + b*y = c or similar. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two equations, and we have two equations, I should use `solve2` with the given equations. Let me assume the format is for linear equations: a1*x + b1*y = c1 and a2*x + b2*y = c2. So equations are:  \n1) 9x + 6y = 48  \n2) -7x + 5y = 40  \nI'll call `solve2` with the list of equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[9, 6, 48], [-7, 5, 40]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x=0.000000, y=8.000000. Let me verify this solution by plugging into both equations:  \n1) 9*0 + 6*8 = 0 + 48 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) -7*0 + 5*8 = 0 + 40 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nThe solution satisfies both equations. Since the task is solved and the answer is verified, I can now output the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=0.000000,y=8.000000"
