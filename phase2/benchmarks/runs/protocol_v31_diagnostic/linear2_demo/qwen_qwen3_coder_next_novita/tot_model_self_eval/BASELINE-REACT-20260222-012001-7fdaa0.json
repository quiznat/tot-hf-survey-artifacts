    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n1) a1\u00b7x + b1\u00b7y = c1  \n2) a2\u00b7x + b2\u00b7y = c2  \n\nSo here:  \n5x - 6y = -42  \n-4x + 6y = 36  \n\nWe can solve this system using algebraic methods (e.g., elimination or substitution). Let\u2019s try elimination:  \nAdd the two equations:  \n(5x - 6y) + (-4x + 6y) = -42 + 36  \n\u2192 (5x - 4x) + (-6y + 6y) = -6  \n\u2192 x = -6  \n\nNow substitute x = -6 into",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From the scratchpad, we have derived x = -6 by adding the two equations. Now we need to substitute x = -6 into one of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation: 5x - 6y = -42. Substituting x = -6 gives: 5(-6) - 6y = -42 \u2192 -30 - 6y = -42 \u2192 -6y = -12 \u2192 y = 2. So the solution is (x, y) = (-6, 2). To verify, we can use the `check_xy` tool with x = -6 and y = 2. Alternatively, we could use `solve2`, but since we already have the solution, verification is efficient. Let's verify with `check_xy`.\nACTION: check_xy -6 2",
