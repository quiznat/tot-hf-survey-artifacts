    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], representing linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 4x + 9y = -9\nEquation 2: 9x - y = 86\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two linear equations with two variables, we can solve this system. The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-equation system). Given that `solve2` is directly applicable to solving two equations, I should use that first.\n\nLet me try calling `solve2` with the equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[4, 9, -9], [9, -1, 86]]",
