    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays. Each inner list likely represents an equation in the form [a, b, c] corresponding to ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -8x - y = 33  \nEquation 2: -8x -7y = -9  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let's use algebra: subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate x.\n\nEquation 1: -8x - y = 33  \nEquation 2: -8x -7y = -9  \nSubtract Eq2 from Eq1:  \n(-8x - y) - (-8x -7y) = 33 - (-9)  \n\u2192 -8x - y + 8x + 7y = 42  \n\u2192 6y = 42 \u2192 y",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: From the scratchpad, we have derived that 6y = 42, so y = 7. Now we can substitute y = 7 into one of the original equations to solve for x. Using Equation 1: -8x - y = 33 \u2192 -8x - 7 = 33 \u2192 -8x = 40 \u2192 x = -5. So the solution is x = -5, y = 7. We can verify using the second equation: -8(-5) -7(7) = 40 - 49 = -9, which matches the RHS. The solution is correct. Since we have solved it manually, we can now output the final answer.\nFINAL: x = -5, y = 7"
