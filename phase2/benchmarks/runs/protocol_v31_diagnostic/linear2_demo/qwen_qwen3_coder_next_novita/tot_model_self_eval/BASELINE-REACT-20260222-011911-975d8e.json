    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form of equations: [[-1, 2, -15], [3, -5, 41]]. This likely represents:\n- Equation 1: -1\u00b7x + 2\u00b7y = -15\n- Equation 2: 3\u00b7x - 5\u00b7y = 41\n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which is likely designed for solving 2-variable linear systems. If not, I can use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions.\n\nFirst, I'll try `solve2` with the coefficient matrix and constants.\n\nTool input format is unclear, but likely `solve2` expects the equations in a structured way \u2014 perhaps",
