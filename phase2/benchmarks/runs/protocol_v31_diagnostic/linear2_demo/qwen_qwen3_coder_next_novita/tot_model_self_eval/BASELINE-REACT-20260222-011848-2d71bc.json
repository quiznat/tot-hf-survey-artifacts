    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n- Equation 1: -2x + 5y = 3\n- Equation 2: 8x + 2y = -34\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve the system. The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-equation system). Given that `solve2` is directly relevant, I should use it.\n\nTool input format is not specified, but since the input is a list of two equations, each with 3 coefficients, I\u2019ll pass the entire list to `solve2`.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-2, 5, 3], [8, 2,",
