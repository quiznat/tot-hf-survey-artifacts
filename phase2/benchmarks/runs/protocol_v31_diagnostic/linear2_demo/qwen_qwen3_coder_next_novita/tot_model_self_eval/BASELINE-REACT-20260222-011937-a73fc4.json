    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \nEquation 1: 8x + 6y = -22  \nEquation 2: 1x + 1y = -4  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic substitution/elimination or use the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the list of equations as given. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution. Since I don\u2019t yet have a solution, I should try `solve2` first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[8, 6, -22], [1, 1",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x = 1.0 and y = -5.0 as a solution. I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool to ensure it satisfies both equations. Let's plug in x = 1, y = -5 into the original equations:  \nEquation 1: 8(1) + 6(-5) = 8 - 30 = -22 \u2714\ufe0f  \nEquation 2: 1(1) + 1(-5) = 1 - 5 = -4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nThe solution checks out.
