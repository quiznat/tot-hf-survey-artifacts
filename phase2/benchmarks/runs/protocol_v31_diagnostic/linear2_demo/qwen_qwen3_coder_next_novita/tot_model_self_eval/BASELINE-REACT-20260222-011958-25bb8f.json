    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of equations. The input is given as `[[4, 2, 36], [2, 4, 18]]`, which likely represents two linear equations in two variables (say x and y). Each inner list `[a, b, c]` probably corresponds to the equation `a*x + b*y = c`. So we have:\n1. `4x + 2y = 36`\n2. `2x + 4y = 18`\n\nWe need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either solve manually or use the available tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable system. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution.\n\nSince `solve2` is available and seems appropriate for solving a 2-equation system, I'll use it. I need to",

The `solve2` tool is designed for solving 2-variable systems, and likely expects input in a format like `[[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]]`, which matches the input exactly.
