    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides the equations in the form of coefficients: [[-5, 7, -41], [5, 7, -1]]. This likely means:\nEquation 1: -5x + 7y = -41  \nEquation 2: 5x + 7y = -1  \n\nI can solve this system manually or use the available tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which is presumably designed for solving 2-variable linear systems. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution. Since I don\u2019t yet have a solution, I should try `solve2` first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-5, 7, -41], [5, 7, -1]]",
