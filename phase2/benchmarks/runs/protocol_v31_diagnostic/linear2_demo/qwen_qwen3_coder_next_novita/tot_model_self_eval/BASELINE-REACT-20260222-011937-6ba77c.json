    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficients: [[1, -8, -29], [-1, -9, -39]].

Wait \u2014 the equations are univariate quadratics, yet tools include `check_xy`, suggesting a bivariate context (e.g., checking if (x, y) satisfies both equations). However, no y appears in the equations. Alternatively, perhaps the task is to solve a *system* of two equations in two variables, and the coefficients represent something like:  \na\u2081x + b\u2081y = c",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The input is [[1, -8, -29], [-1, -9, -39]]. Given the tools `check_xy` and `solve2`, and the fact that each inner list has 3 coefficients, it's likely that each equation is linear in two variables: ax + by = c. So:\n- Equation 1: 1\u00b7x + (\u20138)\u00b7y = \u201329 \u2192 x \u2013 8y = \u201329  \n- Equation 2: \u20131\u00b7x + (\u20139)\u00b7y = \u201339 \u2192 \u2013x \u2013 9y = \u201339 (or x + 9y = 39 after multiplying by \u20131)\n\nThis makes sense: a 2\u00d72 linear system in x and y.
