    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays: [1, -8, -29] and [-1, -9, -39]. These likely represent quadratic equations of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. So:\n- Equation 1: x\u00b2 - 8x - 29 = 0\n- Equation 2: -x\u00b2 - 9x - 39 = 0 (or equivalently, x\u00b2 + 9x + 39 = 0 after multiplying by -1)\n\nThe available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since we have two equations, possibly to solve simultaneously (i.e., find (x, y) satisfying both), but the equations given are univariate (only x terms), so maybe they are meant to be solved individually, or perhaps the coefficients represent something else (e.g., linear equations in x",

Alternatively, perhaps the task is to solve a *system* of two equations in two variables (x, y), and the coefficient arrays encode linear equations like ax + by = c \u2014 but each array has 3 elements, which would match a linear equation in two variables: ax + by = c.
