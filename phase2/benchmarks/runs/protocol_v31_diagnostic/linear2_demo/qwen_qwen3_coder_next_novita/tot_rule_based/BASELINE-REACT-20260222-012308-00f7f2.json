    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input contains a list of two equations, each represented as coefficients [a, b, c] corresponding to equations of the form ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -1\u00b7x + 6\u00b7y = -16 \u2192 -x + 6y = -16\nEquation 2: -1\u00b7x + (-9)\u00b7y = 14 \u2192 -x - 9y = 14\n\nWe need to solve this system of two linear equations in two variables (x, y). Let's solve manually first to verify.\n\nFrom Eq1: -x + 6y = -16 \u2192 x = 6y + 16  \nSubstitute into Eq2: -(6y + 16) - 9y = 14 \u2192 -6y -16 -9y = 14 \u2192 -15",
