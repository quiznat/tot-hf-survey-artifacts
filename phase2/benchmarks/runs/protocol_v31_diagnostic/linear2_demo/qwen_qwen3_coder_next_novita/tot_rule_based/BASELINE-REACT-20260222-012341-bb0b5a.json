    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input contains a list of equations represented as triplets [a, b, c], likely meaning a*x + b*y = c or possibly a*x^2 + b*y^2 = c? But more plausibly, given two equations and two unknowns, it's a linear system: a1*x + b1*y = c1 and a2*x + b2*y = c2. However, the triplets are [7,7,42] and [-5,9,82]. Let's test if these represent equations like x + y = 6 (since 7x + 7y = 42 \u2192 x + y = 6) and -5x + 9y = 82. So first equation: 7x + 7y = 42 \u2192 x + y = 6. Second: -5x + 9y =",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The equations are likely linear systems of the form a*x + b*y = c. From the first triplet [7, 7, 42], we get 7x + 7y = 42 \u2192 x + y = 6. From the second [-5, 9, 82], we get -5x + 9y = 82. To solve this system, I can either solve manually or use the available tools. Since solve2 is likely designed for solving two-variable systems, I should use it. Let me try solve2 with the coefficients: first equation (7, 7, 42), second (-5, 9, 82). Alternatively, check_xy might verify a candidate solution, but I don\u2019t yet have a candidate. So best to call solve2 with the two equations.",

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: The solve2 tool returned x = -2.0 and y = 8.0 as the solution to the system of equations. Let me verify this manually to ensure correctness. First equation: 7x + 7y = 7*(-2) + 7*8 = -14 + 56 = 42 \u2714\ufe0f. Second equation: -5x + 9y = -5*(-2) + 9*8 = 10 + 72 = 82 \u2714\ufe0f. Both equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\nFINAL: x=-2,y=8"
