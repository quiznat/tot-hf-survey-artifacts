    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides a system of two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n1) 5x - 6y = -42\n2) -4x + 6y = 36\n\nI can solve this system using algebra or use the available tools. The tool `solve2` likely solves a system of two linear equations. Let me try using `solve2` with the two equations.\n\nThe input format for `solve2` is not specified, but given the structure of the input, it probably expects the coefficients as lists. So I'll try passing the equations as a list of lists.\n\nAlternatively, I could use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions, but I need a candidate first. Better to use `solve2` directly.\n\nLet me call `solve2` with the equations: [[5, -6,",
