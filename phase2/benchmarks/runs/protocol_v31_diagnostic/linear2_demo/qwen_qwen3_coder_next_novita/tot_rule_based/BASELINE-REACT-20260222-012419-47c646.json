    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing equations like a*x + b*y = c.

Let's try to solve this system manually first.  \nMultiply equation (2) by 2: 4x + 8y = 36  \nSubtract equation (1): (4x + 8y) - (4x + 2y) = 36 - 36 \u2192 6y = 0 \u2192 y = 0  \nPlug y = 0 into equation (1): 4x = 36 \u2192 x = 9  \nSo solution is x = 9, y = 0.\n\nBut instead of computing manually, I should use",

The `check_xy` tool likely verifies a candidate solution (x, y), and `solve2` probably solves a 2-equation system. Since we have exactly two equations, `solve2` is appropriate. I'll use `solve2` with the two equations. The input format for `solve2` is likely the list of equations: [[4,2,36],[2,4,18]].\nACTION: solve2 [[4,2,36],[2,4,18]]",
