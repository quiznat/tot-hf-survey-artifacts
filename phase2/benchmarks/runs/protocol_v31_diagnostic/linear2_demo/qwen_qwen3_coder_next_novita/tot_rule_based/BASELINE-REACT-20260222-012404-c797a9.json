    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations like ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -5x + 6y = 33  \nEquation 2: -4x - 7y = 50  \n\nWe need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution. Since we don\u2019t yet have a solution, `solve2` is more appropriate.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-5, 6, 33], [-4, -7, 50]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x = -9.0 and y = -2.0 as the solution to the system. To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool with the given equations.
