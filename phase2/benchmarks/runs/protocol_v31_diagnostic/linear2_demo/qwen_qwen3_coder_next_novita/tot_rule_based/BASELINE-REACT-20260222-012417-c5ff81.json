    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So the equations are:\n1) 8x + 1y = -24\n2) 6x - 8y = -18\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve the system. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-equation system). Given that `solve2` is directly for solving 2 equations, it's the appropriate first tool to use.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[8, 1, -24], [6, -8, -18]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x = -3.000000 and y = -0.000000 (i.e., y = 0). To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool with the original equations: 8x + y = -24 and 6x - 8y = -18.
