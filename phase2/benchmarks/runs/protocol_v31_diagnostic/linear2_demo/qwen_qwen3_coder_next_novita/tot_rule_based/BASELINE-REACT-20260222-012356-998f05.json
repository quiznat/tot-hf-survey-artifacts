    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c] representing ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -6x - y = -46\nEquation 2: -7x + 3y = -62\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic substitution/elimination manually, or use the available tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. The input format for `solve2` is probably the two equations as lists, i.e., `solve2([[-6, -1, -46], [-7, 3, -62]])`. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a proposed solution, but we don\u2019t have a candidate yet. So best to try `solve2` first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-6, -",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool successfully solved the system and returned x = 8.0 and y = -2.0. Let me verify this solution using the original equations to ensure correctness.\n\nEquation 1: -6x - y = -46  \nPlug in x=8, y=-2: -6(8) - (-2) = -48 + 2 = -46 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEquation 2: -7x + 3y = -62  \nPlug in x=8, y=-2: -7(8) + 3(-2) = -56 - 6 = -62 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.\n\nFINAL: x=8, y=-2"
