    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) 8x - 7y = 46  \n2) 9x - 5y = 46  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two linear equations with two variables, we can solve the system. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-equation system). Given that `solve2` is directly available and likely designed for this purpose, we should use it.\n\nLet\u2019s assume `solve2` takes the list of equations as input. So we pass `[[8, -7, 46], [9, -5, 46]]`.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[8, -7,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned a solution: x = 4.0, y = -2.0. To ensure correctness, we should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool with the original equations. Let's plug x = 4 and y = -2 into both equations:\n\n1) 8x - 7y = 8*4 - 7*(-2) = 32 + 14 = 46 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2) 9x - 5y = 9*4 - 5*(-2) = 36 + 10 = 46 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nBoth equations are satisfied. So the solution is correct. We can now report the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=4,y=-2"
