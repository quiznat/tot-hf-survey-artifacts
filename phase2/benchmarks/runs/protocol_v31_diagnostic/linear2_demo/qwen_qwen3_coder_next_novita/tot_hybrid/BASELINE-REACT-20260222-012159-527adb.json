    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two linear equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n- Equation 1: -5x + 6y = 33\n- Equation 2: -4x - 7y = 50\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the `solve2` tool if it's designed for solving 2x2 linear systems.\n\nLet\u2019s try using `solve2` \u2014 assuming it takes the coefficient matrix and constants vector. But we need to check the expected input format. Since the input is given as lists of [a, b, c], likely `solve2` expects the full system in that format.\n\nAlternatively, `check_xy` might be used to verify a candidate solution",
