    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n-1\u00b7x + 2\u00b7y = -15  \n3\u00b7x - 5\u00b7y = 41  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods or the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2\u00d72 linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the coefficient matrix and constants \u2014 possibly as [[a1, b1], [a2, b2]] and [c1, c2], or directly the augmented rows. Since the input is given as [[-1, 2, -15], [3, -5, 41]], it's",

The `solve2` tool is designed for 2\u00d72 systems, and likely expects input in a structured format \u2014 possibly the coefficient matrix and constant vector separately, or the full augmented matrix. Since the input is already in a clean 2\u00d73 form, `solve2` may accept it directly as the list of equations. Alternatively, `check_xy` could verify candidate solutions, but we need to find the solution first. The most efficient step is to call `solve2` with the given equations. I'll assume `solve2",

Let\u2019s verify by solving algebraically first to confirm. From the first equation:  \n- x + 2y = -15 \u2192 x = 2y + 15  \nSubstitute into second:  \n3(2y + 15) - 5y = 41 \u2192 6y + 45 - 5y = 41 \u2192 y + 45 = 41 \u2192 y = -4  \nThen x = 2(-4) + 15 = -8 + 15 = 7  \nSo solution is (x, y) = (7, -4).  \n\nNow, to use the tools properly: `solve2`",
