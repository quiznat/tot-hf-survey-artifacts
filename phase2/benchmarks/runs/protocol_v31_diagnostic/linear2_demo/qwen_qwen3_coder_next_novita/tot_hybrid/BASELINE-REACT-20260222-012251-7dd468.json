    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n- Equation 1: -5x + 0y = 25 \u2192 -5x = 25\n- Equation 2: 1x + 2y = -11\n\nWe can solve this system manually or use tools. Let's consider using solve2, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system given coefficients.\n\nBut first, let's verify: solve2 probably expects input like [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], which matches our input. So we can directly call solve2 with the given equations.\n\nAlternatively, we could solve step-by-step:\nFrom eq1: -5x = 25 \u2192 x = -5\nPlug into eq2: 1*(-5) +",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The equations are:  \n- Equation 1: -5x + 0y = 25 \u2192 x = -5  \n- Equation 2: x + 2y = -11  \n\nSubstituting x = -5 into equation 2: -5 + 2y = -11 \u2192 2y = -6 \u2192 y = -3.  \nSo the solution is x = -5, y = -3.  \nSince solve2 is designed for 2-variable linear systems and our input matches its expected format, we can directly call solve2([[ -5, 0, 25 ], [ 1, 2, -11 ]]) to verify or obtain the solution. Let's use solve2 for correctness and efficiency.  \nAlternatively, we could use check_xy to verify (x=-5, y=-3), but solve2 is more direct for solving.  \nThus,",
