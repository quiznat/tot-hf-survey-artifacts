    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations.

I can either use algebraic solving or use the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. If not, I can use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions. First, try `solve2` with the equations.\n\nTool input format for `solve2` is likely the list of equations: [[5, -5, 65], [6, -2, 42",
