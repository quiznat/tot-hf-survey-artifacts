    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n1) 8x + 6y = -22  \n2) 1x + 1y = -4  \n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic substitution/elimination or use the provided tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the list of equations as given. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution. Since I don\u2019t yet have a solution, I should try `solve2` first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[8, 6, -22], [1, 1, -4]]",

To ensure correctness, I should verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool, which likely evaluates whether the given x and y satisfy both equations.\n\nACTION: check_xy 1 -5\nSTEP 1 OBSERVATION: True\nTHINK: The `check_xy` tool confirmed that x = 1 and y = -5 satisfy both equations.
