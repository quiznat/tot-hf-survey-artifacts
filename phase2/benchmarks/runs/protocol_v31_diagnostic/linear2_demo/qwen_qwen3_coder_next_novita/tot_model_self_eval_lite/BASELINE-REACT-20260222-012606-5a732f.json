    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form ax + by = c. We have two equations:  \n1) 7x + 7y = -21  \n2) 8x - 4y = -96  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely solves a 2-equation system). Since we have exactly two equations, `solve2` is appropriate. Let\u2019s use `solve2` with the list of equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[7, 7, -21], [8, -4, -96]]",
