    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations: a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 5x - 6y = 58  \nEquation 2: -4x + 8y = -56  \n\nI need to solve for x and y. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let's consider using the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the coefficient matrix and constants \u2014 maybe as a list of equations like the input. Let me try `solve2` with the given equations.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[5, -6, 58], [-4, 8, -56]]",
