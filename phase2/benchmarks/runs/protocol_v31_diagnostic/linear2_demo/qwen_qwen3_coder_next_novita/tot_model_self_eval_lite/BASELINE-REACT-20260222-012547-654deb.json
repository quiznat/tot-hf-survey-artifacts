    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations like ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: 5x - 5y = 65  \nEquation 2: 6x - 2y = 42  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. Let me try that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[5, -5, 65], [6, -2, 42]]",
