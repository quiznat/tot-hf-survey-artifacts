    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form of equations: [[-1, 2, -15], [3, -5, 41]].

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations given as [[-1, 2, -15], [3, -5, 41]], where each list [a, b, c] corresponds to a*x + b*y = c. So the equations are:  \n- -x + 2y = -15  \n- 3x - 5y = 41  \n\nI need to solve for x and y. The `solve2` tool is designed for this purpose. I should pass the coefficient matrix and constant vector appropriately. Since `solve2` likely expects input as two equations in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]] or similar, and the input is already in that format, I can directly use the provided list. Let me try calling `solve2` with the full equations list.  \n\nACTION: solve2",
