    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides the equations in the form of coefficients: [[-5, 7, -41], [5, 7, -1]]. This likely means:\nEquation 1: -5x + 7y = -41  \nEquation 2: 5x + 7y = -1  \n\nWe can solve this system manually or use the available tools. Let's consider using `solve2`, which is presumably designed for solving 2-variable linear systems. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution.\n\nFirst, let's try to solve analytically:  \nAdd the two equations to eliminate x:  \n(-5x + 7y) + (5x + 7y) = -41 + (-1)  \n\u2192 14y = -42  \n\u2192 y = -3  \n\nSubstitute y",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations:  \nEquation 1: -5x + 7y = -41  \nEquation 2: 5x + 7y = -1  \n\nFrom manual solving: adding equations gives 14y = -42 \u2192 y = -3. Substituting y = -3 into Equation 2: 5x + 7(-3) = -1 \u2192 5x - 21 = -1 \u2192 5x = 20 \u2192 x = 4. So candidate solution is (x=4, y=-3). Now I should verify using `check_xy` or directly use `solve2`. Since `solve2` is likely the intended solver for 2-variable systems, I'll use it. Input format probably expects coefficients as in the input: [[-5,7,-41],[5,7,-1",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The system of equations is:  \n-5x + 7y = -41  \n5x + 7y = -1  \n\nManual solution: adding equations gives 14y = -42 \u2192 y = -3. Substituting into second equation: 5x + 7(-3) = -1 \u2192 5x - 21 = -1 \u2192 5x = 20 \u2192 x = 4. So (x=4, y=-3) is the solution. To confirm correctness and follow the ReAct protocol, I should use `check_xy` with this candidate solution, or use `solve2` to get the solution directly. Since `solve2` is designed for solving 2-variable systems, it's more efficient to use it directly. Input format likely expects the coefficient matrix as provided: [[-5,7,-41],[5,7,-1]]",

To obtain the solution reliably and in accordance with the task's available tools, I should use `solve2`, which is designed for solving 2-variable linear systems.
