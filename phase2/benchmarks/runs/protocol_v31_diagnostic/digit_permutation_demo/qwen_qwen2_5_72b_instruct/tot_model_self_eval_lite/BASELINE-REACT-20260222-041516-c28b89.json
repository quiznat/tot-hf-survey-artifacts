    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the provided divisor and does not exceed the oracle_max value. I should first try to form the largest possible number from the given digits and then check if it's divisible by the divisor. If not, I will need to find the next best number that meets the criteria.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [9, 0, 7, 5], \"divisor\": 6, \"max_value\": 9750}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Given the observation, the tool has returned 9750, which is the maximum value allowed (oracle_max). This suggests that 9750 is either the largest number that can be formed from the digits and is divisible by 6, or it's the highest possible number within the constraints. To confirm if 9750 is indeed divisible by 6, I should use the `is_divisible` tool.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 9750, \"divisor\": 6}",
