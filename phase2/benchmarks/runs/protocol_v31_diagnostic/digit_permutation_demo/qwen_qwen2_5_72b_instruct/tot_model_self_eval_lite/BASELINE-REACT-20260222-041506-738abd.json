    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve checking for divisibility by 6 of a number formed from the digits provided. The `is_divisible` tool can check if a number is divisible by a given divisor, and the `best_divisible` tool might help in finding the best number that meets the criteria. Given the `oracle_max` value, we should aim to form the largest possible number from the digits that is less than or equal to `oracle_max` and is divisible by 6. Let's start by generating numbers from the digits and checking their divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [5, 2, 3, 2], \"divisor\": 6, \"max_value\": 5322}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function has returned 5322, which is the largest number that can be formed from the given digits and is divisible by 6, while also being less than or equal to the `oracle_max` value. This means that 5322 is the answer to the task.\n\nFINAL: 5322"
