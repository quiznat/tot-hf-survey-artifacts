    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the provided divisor (7 in this case), while also not exceeding the maximum value set by the oracle (3934). I should start by generating numbers from the given digits and check if they are divisible by 7 and do not exceed the oracle's maximum limit. However, since generating all possible combinations manually would be inefficient, I will use the provided tools to help streamline the process. First, I need to understand how these tools work.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 4, 9, 3], \"divisor\": 7, \"max_value\": 3934}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` tool has returned 3934, which means it found 3934 to be the largest number formed from the given digits that is divisible by 7 and does not exceed the oracle's maximum limit. However, I need to verify if 3934 can actually be formed using the digits [3, 4, 9, 3] and if it is indeed divisible by 7.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 3934, \"divisor\": 7}",
