    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task appears to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the provided divisor (8 in this case) and does not exceed the maximum allowed value (4112). I should start with forming the largest possible number from the digits and then check if it's divisible by 8 and within the limit. If not, I will need to form the next largest possible number and check again until a valid number is found or all possibilities are exhausted.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [1, 2, 4, 1], \"max_value\": 4112}",

However, we need to verify if 4112 is actually divisible by 8 and can be formed using the digits [1, 2, 4, 1].\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4112 8\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: true\nTHINK: 4112 is divisible by 8, but we still need to ensure that it can be formed using the digits [1, 2, 4, 1]. Since 4112 is already the maximum value and it is divisible by 8, we should check if it can be formed with the given digits. Given that 4112 uses the digits 4, 1, 1, and 2, it can indeed be formed from the provided digits.\n\nFINAL:",
