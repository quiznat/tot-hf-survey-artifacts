    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the provided divisor (8 in this case), and it should not exceed the 'oracle_max' value (4128 here). I will start by checking if the largest possible number formed with the digits is divisible by 8 using the `is_divisible` tool.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 8124 8",

I need to ensure that the result is a permutation of the provided digits. Let me re-evaluate the permutations manually and check each one for divisibility by 8 and compliance with the `oracle_max`.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 2481 8\nSTEP 3 OBSERVATION: no\nTHINK: 2481 is not divisible by 8. Let's try another permutation.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 2841 8\nSTEP 4 OBSERVATION: no\nTHINK: 2841 is also not divisible by 8. We need to continue trying other permutations.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4281 8\nSTEP",

We need to keep testing other permutations until we find one that meets all the criteria.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4128 8\nSTEP 4 OBSERVATION: yes\nTHINK: 4128 is divisible by 8 and does not exceed the `oracle_max` value. However, we need to ensure that 4128 can be formed from the given digits [2, 4, 8, 1]. Since 4128 is a valid permutation of the digits, it meets all the criteria.\n\nFINAL: 4128"
