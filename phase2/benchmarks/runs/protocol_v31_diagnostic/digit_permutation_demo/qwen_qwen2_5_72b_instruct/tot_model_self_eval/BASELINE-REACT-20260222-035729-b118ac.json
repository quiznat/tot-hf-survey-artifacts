    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task appears to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the provided divisor and does not exceed the oracle_max value. I should start by generating the largest possible number from the digits and then check if it's divisible by the divisor. If not, I will need to iterate downwards until I find a number that meets all criteria.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [7, 1, 6, 5], \"divisor\": 7, \"max_value\": 7651}",

Since this is within the constraints specified in the task, I can conclude that this is the final answer.\n\nFINAL: 7651"
