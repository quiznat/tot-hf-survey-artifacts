    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the provided digits [4, 4, 9, 4] which is divisible by the given divisor (6), and it should not exceed the oracle_max value (9444). I will start by attempting to form the largest possible number from the digits and then check if it's divisible by 6.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [4, 4, 9, 4] 6 9444",

There is no need to perform further checks as this satisfies all the conditions of the task.\n\nFINAL: 9444"
