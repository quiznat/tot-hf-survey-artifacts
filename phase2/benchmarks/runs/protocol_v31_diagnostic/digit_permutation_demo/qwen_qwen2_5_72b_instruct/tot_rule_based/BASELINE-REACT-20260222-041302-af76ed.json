    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits, which is also divisible by the given divisor (4 in this case). We have a maximum value (`oracle_max`) which is 9852, and we need to ensure that the number we form does not exceed this value. The `best_divisible` tool might help us find the best number that meets our criteria, while the `is_divisible` tool can check if a number is divisible by the divisor. I should start by trying to form the largest possible number from the digits and then use the `is_divisible` tool to check if it's divisible by 4.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [9, 8, 5, 2], \"divisor\": 4, \"max_value\": 9852}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function has returned 9852, which is the `oracle_max` value provided. Since this is the largest number we can form with the given digits that is also divisible by 4, there is no need to try any other combinations or further checks.\n\nFINAL: 9852"
