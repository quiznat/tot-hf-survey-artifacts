    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to find the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is also divisible by the given divisor. The maximum possible value according to the oracle is 9636. I should start by trying to form numbers in descending order and check if they are divisible by the divisor. First, let's try the best_divisible tool with the provided digit list and divisor to see what it returns.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [9, 3, 6, 6], \"divisor\": 4}",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 9636",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The best_divisible tool returned 9636, which is equal to the oracle_max value and is within the limit. It seems that 9636 is the largest number that can be formed from the given digits [9, 3, 6, 6] and is divisible by 4. Before finalizing the answer, I will use the is_divisible tool to confirm that 9636 is indeed divisible by 4.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 9636, \"divisor\": 4}",
