    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve finding the largest number that can be formed with the given digits, which is also divisible by the given divisor (7), and is not greater than the oracle_max (4319). I should start by trying to form the largest possible number from the digits provided and then check if it is divisible by 7. If not, I will need to adjust the number accordingly.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {'digits': [4, 3, 9, 1], 'max_value': 4319, 'divisor': 7}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` tool returned 4319, which means that 4319 is the largest number formed from the given digits that is also divisible by 7 and does not exceed the `oracle_max`. Since this satisfies all conditions, we can conclude that this is our final answer.\n\nFINAL: 4319"
