    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to find the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the given divisor and does not exceed the maximum value provided by the oracle. The first step is to try to form the largest possible number from the given digits and check if it's divisible by the divisor and within the limit.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [7, 2, 4, 5], \"divisor\": 6, \"max_value\": 7542}",

Since this number meets all the criteria, I can conclude that this is the final answer.\n\nFINAL: 7542"
