    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the best divisible number from a list of digits with a given divisor and an upper limit. I should start by checking if any combination of these digits can form a number that is divisible by the divisor (8 in this case) and does not exceed the oracle max (4112). First, I will try to generate numbers from the digits and check for divisibility.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 1241 8\n\nTHINK: Before proceeding with the action, I realize I need to generate all possible combinations of the digits to ensure I don't miss a potential solution. I should generate these combinations and then test each one for divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [1, 2, 4, 1] 8 4112",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function did not find a valid number that meets the criteria. This could mean that either no combination of the given digits forms a number divisible by 8 and less than or equal to 4112, or there was an issue with how the function was called. To ensure accuracy, I should manually generate all permutations of the digits and check each permutation for divisibility and the condition of being less than or equal to 4112.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 1241 8\nACTION: is_divisible 1421 8\nACTION: is_divisible 2141 8\nACTION: is_divisible 2411 8\nACTION: is_divisible 4121 8\nACTION: is_divisible 4211 8\nACTION: is_divisible 1124 8\nACTION:",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Since the `is_divisible` checks for specific permutations have also come back negative, it suggests that none of the permutations of the digits [1, 2, 4, 1] form a number that is divisible by 8 and within the specified limit of 4112. However, I should double-check by ensuring that all permutations have been tested.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 1142 8\nACTION: is_divisible 1214 8\nACTION: is_divisible 1412 8\nACTION: is_divisible 2114 8\nACTION: is_divisible 2141 8\nACTION: is_divisible 2411 8\nACTION: is_divisible 4112 8\nACTION: is_divisible 4121 8\nACTION: is_divisible 4211",
