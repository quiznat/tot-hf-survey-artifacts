    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is divisible by the given divisor and is also less than or equal to the oracle_max. I will start by trying to form the largest number possible with the digits provided and then check if it is divisible by the divisor. If not, I will use the best_divisible function to find the best solution.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [3, 1, 6, 2], \"divisor\": 4, \"oracle_max\": 6312}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since the result from the `best_divisible` function is 6312, which matches the `oracle_max`, it's the largest possible number that can be formed from the given digits and is divisible by the divisor 4. There\u2019s no need for further actions as we have found the best solution.\n\nFINAL: 6312"
