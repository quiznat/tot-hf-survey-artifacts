    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves checking if the number formed by the given digits is divisible by the provided divisor. We can form the number and then use the `is_divisible` tool to check its divisibility. However, since we have an `oracle_max` value, it suggests there might be a need to optimize or ensure we are within certain constraints. Let's first form the number from the digits.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [6, 9, 9, 5], \"divisor\": 5, \"oracle_max\": 9965}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function has returned 9965, which is the largest number formed by the given digits that is less than or equal to `oracle_max` and is divisible by the given divisor. Since this is a valid result and meets the criteria, we can conclude our task.\n\nFINAL: 9965"
