    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to require checking if a number composed of the digits provided can be divided by the given divisor and also does not exceed a certain maximum value ('oracle_max'). I will start by generating the largest possible number from the digits that doesn't exceed the oracle_max and check if it's divisible by the divisor.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [4, 3, 2, 1], \"divisor\": 11, \"max_value\": 4312}",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 4312",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since the best_divisible tool returned a number (4312) which is equal to the oracle_max, this suggests that 4312 is the largest number formed by the given digits that is divisible by the divisor 11 and does not exceed the maximum allowed value. No further checks are needed as we have found a valid solution that meets all criteria.\n\nFINAL: 4312"
