    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 4, 9, 8] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is 9840, so the answer must be less than or equal to 9840.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that's divisible by 8.\n\nLet me try to construct the largest possible number using these digits that meets the criteria.\n\nThe available digits are: 0, 4, 9, 8\n\nTo make the largest number, I should arrange them in descending order: 9840\nBut I need to check if this number is actually divisible by 8.\n\nActually, let me approach this systematically using the available tools.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [0, 4",

I'll use the best_divisible tool properly with the correct JSON format, and then verify using is_divisible if needed.\n\nLooking at the digits [0, 4, 9, 8], to make the largest number \u2264 9840, I should try arrangements starting with 9, then 8, etc., while checking divisibility by 8.\n\nThe largest possible arrangement is 9840, but I need to verify if it's divisible by 8.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [0, 4, 9, 8], \"max_value\": 9840}",
