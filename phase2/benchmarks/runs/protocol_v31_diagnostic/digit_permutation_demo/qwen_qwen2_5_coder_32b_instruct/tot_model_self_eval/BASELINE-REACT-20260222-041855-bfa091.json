    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 5536. \n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this systematically:\n1. I have digits [3, 5, 6, 5] - I can use each digit exactly once\n2. I want the largest possible number \u2264 5536 that's divisible by 8\n3.
