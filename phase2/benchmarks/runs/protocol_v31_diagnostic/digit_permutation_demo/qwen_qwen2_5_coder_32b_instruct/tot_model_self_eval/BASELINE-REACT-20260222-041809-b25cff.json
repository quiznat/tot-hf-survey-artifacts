    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max of 4319 suggests this is a constraint on the maximum value I should consider.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 4, 3, 9, 1. I can arrange them in different orders to create different 4-digit numbers.\n\nSince I want the largest possible number that's divisible by 7, I should start by trying arrangements that form larger numbers first. The largest arrangement would be 9431, but I need to check if it's divisible by 7.\n\nLet me use the tools available to check divisibility and find the best divisible number.\nACTION: is_divisible 9431 7",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The number 9431 is not divisible by 7. I need to try other arrangements of the digits [4, 3, 9, 1] to find the largest one that is divisible by 7. Since 9431 is too large (exceeds oracle_max of 4319), I should look for arrangements that are less than or equal to 4319.\n\nLet me try the next largest arrangements systematically. The largest arrangement that doesn't exceed 4319 would be 4391, but that's still larger than 4319. So I need to check arrangements that are \u2264 4319.\n\nThe largest valid arrangement would be 4319 itself, but I need to check if it uses exactly the digits [4, 3, 9, 1]. Let me verify: 4319 uses",
