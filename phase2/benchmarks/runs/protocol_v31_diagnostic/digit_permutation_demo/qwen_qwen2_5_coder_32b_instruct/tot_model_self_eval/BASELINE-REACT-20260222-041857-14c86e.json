    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 9, 2, 3] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value is 9023, so I should look for numbers up to this value.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 0, 9, 2, 3. I can arrange them in different orders to create various numbers.\n\nSince I want the largest possible number that's divisible by 7 and doesn't exceed 9023, I should start by trying arrangements that form large numbers first.\n\nLet me try to use the best_divisible tool to help me find the answer systematically.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [0, 9, 2, 3], \"divisor\": 7, \"max_value\": 9",
