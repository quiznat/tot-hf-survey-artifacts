The oracle_max of 9636 suggests this should be a 4-digit number.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check all possible combinations of the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] to find the largest one divisible by 4.\n\nThe available tools are:\n1. best_divisible - likely finds the best divisible number\n2. is_divisible - checks if a number is divisible by the divisor\n\nSince I want the largest number, I should try to arrange the digits in descending order first and then check divisibility.\n\nThe largest possible arrangement would be 9663, but I",
