    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 5536. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nSince I have the digits [3, 5, 6, 5], I need to:\n1. Try different arrangements of these digits to form 4-digit numbers\n2. Check which ones are divisible by 8 (using the last three digits rule)\n3. Ensure the result doesn't exceed 5536\n4. Find the maximum such number\n\nLet me start by trying to form numbers and check divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible",
