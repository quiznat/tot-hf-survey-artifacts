    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 9, 2, 3] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value is 9023, so I should look for numbers up to this value.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 0, 9, 2, 3. I can arrange them in different orders to create various numbers.\n\nSince I want the largest possible number that's divisible by 7 and doesn't exceed 9023, I should start by trying arrangements that form large numbers first.\n\nLet me try to form the largest possible number with these digits: 9320. But I need to check if it's divisible by 7.\n\nActually, let me approach this systematically using the available tools. I'll use the best_divisible",
