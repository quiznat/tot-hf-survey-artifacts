I should first try to form the largest possible number and then check if it's divisible by 8. If not, I'll need to rearrange the digits to find a number that is divisible by 8.\n\nLet me start by trying to form the largest number possible with these digits, which would be 4211, and then check if it's divisible by 8.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4211 8\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The oracle_max is 4112, so I need to find a number \u2264 4112 that uses the given digits and is divisible by 8.\n\nLet me think systematically about what numbers I can make with digits [1, 2, 4, 1]",
