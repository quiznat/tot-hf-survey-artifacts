    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 8, 1, 6] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max of 5816 suggests this is a constraint on the maximum value we should consider.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits and check which ones are divisible by 8.\n\nThe available digits are: 5, 8, 1, 6\n\nTo be divisible by 8, a number must be divisible by 8. A useful rule is that for a number to be divisible by 8, its last three digits must form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me first check all possible 4-digit combinations and see which ones are divisible by 8, keeping in mind the oracle_max constraint of 5816.\n\nActually, let me approach this systematically using the available tools.\n\nACTION: best_div",
