    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 3] that is divisible by 4 and does not exceed 5360.\n\nFirst, let me understand what I'm looking for:\n1. A number using digits [5, 6, 0, 3] (each digit used exactly once)\n2. The number must be divisible by 4\n3. The number must not exceed 5360\n\nLet me think about the divisibility rule for 4: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me first check which two-digit combinations from {5, 6, 0, 3} are divisible by 4:\n- 03 = 3 (not divisible by 4)\n- 05 = 5 (not divisible by 4)",
