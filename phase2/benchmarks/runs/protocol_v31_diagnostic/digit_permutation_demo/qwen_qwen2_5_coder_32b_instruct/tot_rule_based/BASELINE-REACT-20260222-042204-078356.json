    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 7, 6, 2] that is divisible by 3.

However, I also need to ensure this number is divisible by 3.\n\nFirst, let me check if the sum of all digits is divisible by 3:\n9 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 24\nSince 24 is divisible by 3, any arrangement of these digits will form a number divisible by 3.\n\nTo get the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order: 9762.\n\nLet me verify this with the available tools to make sure it's correct and check if there might be a larger valid number within the oracle_max limit (9762).\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits",

The sum of digits is 9 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 24, which is divisible by 3, so any arrangement will be divisible by 3.\n2. To maximize the number, I arrange digits in descending order: 9762.\n3.
