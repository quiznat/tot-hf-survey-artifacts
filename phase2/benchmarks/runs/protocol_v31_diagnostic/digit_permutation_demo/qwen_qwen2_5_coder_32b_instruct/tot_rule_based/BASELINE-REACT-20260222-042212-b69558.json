    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5] that is divisible by 5. \n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 5: a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is either 0 or 5.\n\nLooking at my available digits [6, 9, 9, 5], I see that I have a 5 available. This means I can form numbers ending in 5, which will be divisible by 5.\n\nTo make the largest possible number, I should arrange the remaining digits (6, 9, 9) in descending order to form the largest prefix, then append the 5 at the end.\n\nSo the largest number would be: 9965\n\nLet me verify this is correct by checking if 9965 is divisible by 5:",
