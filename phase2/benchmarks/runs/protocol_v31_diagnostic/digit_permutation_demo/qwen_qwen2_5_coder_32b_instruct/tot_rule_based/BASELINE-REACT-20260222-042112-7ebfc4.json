    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max of 9852 suggests this should be less than or equal to 9852.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check all possible combinations of the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] to find the largest one that's divisible by 4 and \u2264 9852.\n\nThe approach:\n1. Generate all permutations of the digits\n2. Check which ones are divisible by 4 (last two digits divisible by 4)\n3. Among those, find the largest one \u2264 9852\n\nActually, let me use the available tools more systematically.",
