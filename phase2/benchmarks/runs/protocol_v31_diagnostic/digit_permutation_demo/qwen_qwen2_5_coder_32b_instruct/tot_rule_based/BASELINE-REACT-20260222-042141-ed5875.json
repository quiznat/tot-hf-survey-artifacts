    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 5, 2, 3] that is divisible by 5. Since we want the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order, but I also need to ensure the number ends in 0 or 5 (the divisibility rule for 5). Looking at the available digits [8, 5, 2, 3], I see that 5 is already present, so any arrangement ending in 5 will be divisible by 5. To maximize the number, I should place the largest digits first, followed by 5 at the end.\n\nLet me try arranging the digits in descending order and check if it's divisible by 5. The digits are 8, 5, 2, 3. Arranging them in descending order gives us 8532. But this doesn't end in",
