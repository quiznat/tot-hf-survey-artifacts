    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4. I should first check what arrangements of these digits might work, and then verify divisibility by 4.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this systematically:\n1. The largest possible number would be 9663 (arranging digits in descending order)\n2. But I need to check if any arrangement is divisible by 4\n3. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4\n\nLet me try different arrangements and check divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [9, 3, 6, 6], \"divisor\": 4}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I've found that 9636 is the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4. Let me verify this is correct by checking:\n1. The digits used are exactly [9, 3, 6, 6] - yes, each digit is used once\n2. 9636 \u00f7 4 = 2409, which is an integer - yes, it's divisible by 4\n3. This should be the maximum possible value since we're using the largest digits in the highest place values\n\nFINAL: 9636"
