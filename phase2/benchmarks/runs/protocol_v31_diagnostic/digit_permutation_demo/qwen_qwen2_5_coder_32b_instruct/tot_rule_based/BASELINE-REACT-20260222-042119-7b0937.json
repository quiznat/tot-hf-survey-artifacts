The oracle_max constraint tells me the answer cannot exceed 7651. \n\nFirst, I should understand what numbers I can form with these digits and check which ones are divisible by 7.\n\nLet me try to construct the largest possible number first - that would be 7651, but I need to check if this uses only the available digits [7, 1, 6, 5]. Looking at 7651, it uses all four digits exactly once, so it's a valid candidate.\n\nHowever, I should verify if 7651 is actually divisible by 7, or if there's a smaller number that works better.\n\nLet me use the is_divisible tool to check if 7651 is divisible by",
