The oracle_max of 9420 suggests there's an upper limit, but I should first determine what the maximum possible number is using these digits.\n\nTo maximize the number, I should arrange the digits in descending order: 9420. However, I need to check if this number is divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n- For divisibility by 2: the last digit must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)\n- For divisibility by 3: the sum of all digits must be divisible by 3\n\nLet me check if 9420 is divisible by 6:\n- Last digit",
