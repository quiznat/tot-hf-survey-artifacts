    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 4312.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with digits [4, 1, 2, 3]. Since I have 4 digits, I can form 4! = 24 different 4-digit numbers.\n\nTo be divisible by 8, a number must be divisible by 8. A quick way to check divisibility by 8 is to see if the last three digits of the number form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n1. Generate all possible 4-digit combinations from [4, 1, 2, 3]\n2. Check which ones are divisible by 8\n3. Find the maximum among",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me reconsider this problem more carefully. I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] exactly once that is divisible by 8, with the constraint that it cannot exceed 4312.\n\nSince I want the largest number, I should try to arrange the digits in descending order first (4321) and work my way down until I find a valid number.\n\nHowever, I also need to check divisibility by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me start by checking if 4321 is divisible by 8:\nLast three digits: 321\n321 \u00f7 8 = 40.125 (not divisible)\n\nLet me try other arrangements systematically, starting with the largest possible numbers:\n- 432",
