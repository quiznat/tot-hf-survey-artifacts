    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [2, 4, 8, 1] that is divisible by 8. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that's divisible by 8.\n\nGiven digits: [2, 4, 8, 1]\nDivisor: 8\n\nI want to find the largest possible number using these digits that is divisible by 8.\n\nTo maximize the number, I should arrange the digits in descending order as much as possible, but I also need to ensure the last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me try different arrangements and check divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [2, 4, 8, 1], \"divisor\": 8",
