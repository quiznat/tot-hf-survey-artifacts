    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 3] that is divisible by 4 and does not exceed 5360.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 5, 6, 0, 3. I can arrange them in different orders to create various 4-digit numbers.\n\nTo be divisible by 4, a number must have its last two digits forming a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me first check which pairs from my digits can form numbers divisible by 4:\n- 03 = 3 (not divisible by 4)\n- 05 = 5 (not divisible by 4)\n- 06 = 6 (not divisible by 4)\n- 30 = 30 (not divisible by 4)\n- 35",
