    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 1, 2, 3] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 4312. \n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n1. I need to create the largest possible number using the digits [4, 1, 2, 3]\n2. Check if it's divisible by 8\n3. If not, try other arrangements\n4. But I also need to respect the oracle_max constraint (4312)\n\nActually, let me reconsider - I want the largest number \u2264 4312 that uses these digits and is divisible by 8.\n\nThe largest arrangement of",
