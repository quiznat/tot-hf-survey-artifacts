    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 7, 2] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 9732.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check all possible 4-digit combinations of the given digits and see which ones are divisible by 4, keeping in mind the oracle_max constraint.\n\nThe available digits are: 9, 3, 7, 2\n\nTo maximize the number, I should try to arrange these digits in descending order first, but ensure the resulting number is divisible by 4.\n\nLet me start by checking if 9732 itself works (it's the oracle_max), then work backwards to find the largest",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me approach this systematically. I need to find the largest number using digits [9, 3, 7, 2] that is divisible by 4 and doesn't exceed 9732.\n\nFirst, let me check if 9732 itself is divisible by 4 by looking at its last two digits: 32. Since 32 \u00f7 4 = 8, 9732 is divisible by 4. This satisfies the oracle_max constraint.\n\nHowever, I should verify if there's a larger valid number. Since we want the largest number, I'll try arrangements in descending order:\n- 9732 (already checked, divisible by 4)\n- 9723 (last two digits: 23, 23\u00f74 = 5.75, not divisible by 4)\n- 9372 (last two digits:",

Now I need to check other arrangements to see if any are larger than 9732 but still valid.\n\nSince 9732 is the maximum allowed by oracle_max, and it's divisible by 4, I should check if there are any other valid arrangements that might be larger than 9732 but still within the constraints.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - since 9732 is the oracle_max, and it's divisible by 4, it's the largest possible number that meets all criteria. But I should double-check by trying other arrangements to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nLet me use the best_divisible tool to help me",
