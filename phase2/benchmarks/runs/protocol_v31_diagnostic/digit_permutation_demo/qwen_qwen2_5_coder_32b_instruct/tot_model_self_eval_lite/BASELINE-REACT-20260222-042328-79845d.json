    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [2, 2, 2, 5] that is divisible by 7. Since I want the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order first (5222) and then check if it's divisible by 7. If not, I'll need to try other arrangements.\n\nLet me start by checking if 5222 is divisible by 7 using the is_divisible tool.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 5222 7\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The oracle_max is 5222, which suggests that 5222 might be the maximum possible number from these digits, but I should verify if it's actually divisible by 7 or if there's a smaller arrangement that works.\n\nActually, let me approach this systematically. First, I'll check what the largest possible number is with",
