Let me verify this is correct by checking if 7651 is divisible by 7 and if it's indeed formed using the digits [7, 1, 6, 5].\n\nFirst, I'll check if 7651 is divisible by 7:\n7651 \u00f7 7 = 1093 (exact division)\n\nNext, I'll verify that 7651 uses exactly the digits 7, 1, 6, 5:\n- It contains 7, 6, 5, 1 - yes, all required digits are used exactly once.\n\nSince 7651 meets both criteria (divisible by 7 and uses the given digits), and it's less than or equal to the oracle_max of 7651, this appears to be the correct answer.\n\nFINAL:",
