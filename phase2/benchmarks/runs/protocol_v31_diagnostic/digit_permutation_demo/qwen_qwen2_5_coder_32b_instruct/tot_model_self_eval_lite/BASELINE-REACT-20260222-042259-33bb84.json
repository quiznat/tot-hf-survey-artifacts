    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 3] that is divisible by 4 and is less than or equal to 5360.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 5, 6, 0, 3. I can arrange them in different orders to create various 4-digit numbers.\n\nTo be divisible by 4, a number must have its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nLet me first check which pairs of digits from {5, 6, 0, 3} can form numbers divisible by 4 when placed at the end:\n- 03: 3 is not divisible by 4\n- 05: 5 is not divisible by 4  \n- 06: 6 is not divisible by 4",
