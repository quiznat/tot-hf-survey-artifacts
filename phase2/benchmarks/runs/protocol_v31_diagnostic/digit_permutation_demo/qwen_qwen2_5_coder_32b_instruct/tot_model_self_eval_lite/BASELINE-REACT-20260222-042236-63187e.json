    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max is 9852, so I should look for numbers less than or equal to 9852.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4.\n\nLet me check all possible 4-digit combinations of the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] and see which ones are divisible by 4, keeping in mind the constraint that the result must be \u2264 9852.\n\nThe largest possible number would be 9852, but I need to check if it's actually made from these digits. 9852 uses digits 9, 8, 5,",
