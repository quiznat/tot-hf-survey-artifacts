I want the largest number divisible by 7\n3. Since I want the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order first: 9320\n4. But I need to check if this is divisible by 7\n5.

The next largest arrangement would be 9302, then 9230, etc.\n\nHowever, since I'm looking for the largest number that works, it might be more efficient to use the \"best_divisible\" tool which is designed specifically for finding the best divisible number given constraints.\n\nLet me try using the best_divisible tool with the available digits and divisor.\nACTION: best_divisible [0, 9, 2, 3] 7\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: 9023\nFINAL: 9023"
