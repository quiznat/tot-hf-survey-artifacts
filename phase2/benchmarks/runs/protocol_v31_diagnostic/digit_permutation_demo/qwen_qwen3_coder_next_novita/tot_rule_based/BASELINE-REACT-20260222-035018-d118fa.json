    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 3, 7, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle_max is 9732. First, I need to understand the rules: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. So I should consider permutations of the digits and check which ones are divisible by 4, aiming for the maximum possible number (which should be \u2264 9732). Since 9732 is the oracle_max, it's likely the correct answer if it's divisible by 4. Let me check if 9732 is divisible by 4 using the is_divisible tool. The last two digits are 32, and 32 \u00f7 4 = 8, so yes, 9732 is divisible by 4",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 9732, and I suspect it may be the answer. To verify, I need to check if 9732 is divisible by 4. As noted, a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits of 9732 are 32, and 32 \u00f7 4 = 8, so it is divisible. However, I should confirm using the is_divisible tool to be precise. Since the digits [9, 3, 7, 2] can form 9732 (digits match), and it's divisible by 4, and it's the maximum possible permutation (9732 is the largest arrangement of those digits), it's likely the correct answer. But I should still validate with the tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 9732",
