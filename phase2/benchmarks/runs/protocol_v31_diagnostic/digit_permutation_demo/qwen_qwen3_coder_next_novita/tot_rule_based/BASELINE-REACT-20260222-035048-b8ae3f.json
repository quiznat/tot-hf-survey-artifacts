    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 4, 9, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and we\u2019re told the oracle says the maximum is 9840. Let\u2019s verify if 9840 is indeed divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 9840, last three digits are 840. 840 \u00f7 8 = 105, so yes, 840 is divisible by 8. Also, 9840 uses digits 9, 8, 4, 0 \u2014 exactly the given digits. So 9840 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the max, and it's valid, the answer should",
