    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and we know the oracle says the maximum possible is 9444. Let's recall: a number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 4 (since digits are 4,4,9,4 \u2014 only 4 is even).  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 4+4+9+4 = 21 \u2192 21 mod 3 = 0 \u2192 all permutations are divisible by 3.  \nSo only need to ensure last digit is 4. To maximize the number, we",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: To maximize the number, we want the largest possible digits in the highest place values, with the constraint that the last digit must be 4 (to ensure divisibility by 2). Since we have three 4s and one 9, the largest arrangement would start with 9, then the remaining digits in descending order, ending with a 4. So candidate numbers: 9444, 9444 (same), 9444 \u2014 actually, with digits [9,4,4,4], the largest permutation is 9444. Since sum = 21 (divisible by 3) and last digit is 4 (even), 9444 is divisible by 6. The oracle says max is 9444, so likely that's the answer. Let's verify using the tools to be safe. First, check if 9444",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: We have determined that 9444 is the largest permutation of [4,4,9,4], and due to digit sum 21 (divisible by 3) and last digit 4 (even), it should be divisible by 6. To confirm, we should use the `is_divisible` tool to verify divisibility by 6 directly, as the tools are available. Alternatively, we could check divisibility by 2 and 3 separately, but `is_divisible` likely checks for the given divisor (6). Let's use `is_divisible` with input 9444 and divisor 6.\nACTION: is_divisible 9444 6",
