    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 9, 8, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is 9888, which is the largest possible number with those digits. We need to check divisibility by 6 \u2014 a number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nDivisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 8 (we have three 8s, so okay).\n\nDivisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 8 + 9 + 8 + 8 = 33, which is divisible by 3 (33 \u00f7 3 = 11). So any permutation of these digits is divisible by 3. Therefore, we only need",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since the sum of digits is 33 (divisible by 3) and all digits include at least one even digit (8), any permutation ending in 8 will be divisible by both 2 and 3, hence by 6. The largest possible number is 9888, and we should first check if it's divisible by 6. Since 9888 ends in 8 (even) and digit sum is 33 (divisible by 3), it should be divisible by 6. Let's verify using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 9888 6",
