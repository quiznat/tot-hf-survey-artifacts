The oracle_max is 4319, which is the maximum possible number formed by those digits (since digits sorted descending are 9, 4, 3, 1 \u2192 9431? Wait, but oracle_max is given as 4319 \u2014 that suggests maybe the digits must be used in the order given? Or perhaps the oracle_max is just an upper bound, not necessarily the max permutation. But the problem says \"formed from the digits\", so permutations are allowed. However, 9431 > 4319, so 4319 is not the max permutation. So likely, oracle_max is just an upper bound provided by the oracle (maybe to limit search), and we need to find the",

Since 4319 itself is a permutation of the digits and is the largest possible number \u2264 4319 (as any larger permutation like 9431, 9341, etc., exceeds 4319), we should first test if 4319 is divisible by 7.
