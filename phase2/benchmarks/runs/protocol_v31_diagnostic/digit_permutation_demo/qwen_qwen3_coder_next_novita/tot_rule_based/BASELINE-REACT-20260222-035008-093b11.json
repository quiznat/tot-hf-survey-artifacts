    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 8, 5, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9852. Let's verify if 9852 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits of 9852 are 52. 52 \u00f7 4 = 13, so 52 is divisible by 4, meaning 9852 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle_max is 9852 and it's divisible by 4, and it's the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending), then 9852 is the answer. I can confirm using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 9",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The is_divisible tool returned \"no\" for input 9, but that doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 the tool likely expects the full number, not a digit. My earlier reasoning assumed 9852 is divisible by 4 (since 52 \u00f7 4 = 13), but the tool\u2019s response suggests either I misinterpreted the input format or the tool is checking something else. Let me double-check: 9852 \u00f7 4 = 2463, which is an integer, so 9852 *is* divisible by 4. The tool input \"9\" was incorrect \u2014 I should have passed the full number. Let\u2019s try again with the correct input: 9852.\nACTION: is_divisible 9852",
