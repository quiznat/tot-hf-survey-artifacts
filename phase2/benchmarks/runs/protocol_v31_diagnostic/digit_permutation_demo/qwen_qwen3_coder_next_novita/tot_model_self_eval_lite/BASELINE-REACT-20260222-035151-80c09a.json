    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [2, 2, 2, 5] (i.e., using all digits exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 5222, which suggests the maximum possible number from those digits is 5222 (since digits sorted descending: 5,2,2,2 \u2192 5222). We need to find the largest permutation \u2264 5222 that is divisible by 7.\n\nWe have two tools:\n- `is_divisible(n, divisor)` \u2014 checks if n is divisible by divisor.\n- `best_divisible(digits, divisor)` \u2014 likely returns the largest number formed by permuting digits divisible by divisor.\n\nBut since the task is to solve using ReAct loop, and we have the digits and divisor, we can try to use `",

The maximum possible number from these digits is 5222 (digits sorted descending). The oracle_max = 5222 confirms this is the upper bound. We need to check permutations of [2,2,2,5] in descending order until we find one divisible by 7. Since there are only 4! / 3! = 4 distinct permutations (due to three 2s), we can enumerate them: 5222, 2522, 2252, 2225. Let's check divisibility by 7 starting from the largest.\n\nFirst, check 5222 using `is_divisible(5222,",
