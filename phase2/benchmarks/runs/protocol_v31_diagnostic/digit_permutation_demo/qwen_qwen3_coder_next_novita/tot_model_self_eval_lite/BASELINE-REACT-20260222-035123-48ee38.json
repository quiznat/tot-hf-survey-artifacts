    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [4, 3, 2, 1] (i.e., using each digit exactly once) that is divisible by 11. The oracle_max is given as 4312, which suggests that 4312 is the correct answer (since it's the maximum possible permutation and also divisible by 11). Let's verify:  \n- 4312 \u00f7 11 = 392, and 11 \u00d7 392 = 4312 \u2192 yes, divisible.  \n- It uses digits 4, 3, 1, 2 \u2014 exactly the given digits.  \n- It's the largest possible permutation of [4,3,2,1] (since 4321 is not divisible by 11, next is 4",
