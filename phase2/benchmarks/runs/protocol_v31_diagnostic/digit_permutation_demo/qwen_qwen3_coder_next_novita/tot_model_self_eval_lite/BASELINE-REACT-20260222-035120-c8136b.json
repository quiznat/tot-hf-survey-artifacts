    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 0, 9, 5] that is divisible by 5, and we are told the oracle_max is 9650. Let's verify if 9650 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 9650 ends in 0, so it is divisible by 5. Also, 9650 uses digits 9, 6, 5, 0 \u2014 exactly the given digits. So 9650 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle_max is given as 9650, and it satisfies the conditions, it's likely the answer. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the tools. Let's use is_divisible to check 9650 % 5",

Since 9650 ends in 0, it should be divisible by 5, but we need to use the tool as per the ReAct loop protocol to be formal.\nACTION: is_divisible 9650",
