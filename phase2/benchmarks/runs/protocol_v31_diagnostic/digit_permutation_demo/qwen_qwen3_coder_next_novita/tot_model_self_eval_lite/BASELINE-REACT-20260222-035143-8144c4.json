    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [3, 5, 6, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle_max is 5536. Since the oracle_max is given as 5536, it suggests that 5536 is the correct answer (or at least an upper bound), but we need to verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, check if 5536 is divisible by 8 using the `is_divisible` tool. If yes, and it uses the digits [3,5,6,5] (but wait \u2014 5536 uses digits [5,5,3,6] \u2014 yes, same multiset), then it's valid.\n\nDigits of 5536: 5,5,3,6 \u2014 matches [3,5,6",
