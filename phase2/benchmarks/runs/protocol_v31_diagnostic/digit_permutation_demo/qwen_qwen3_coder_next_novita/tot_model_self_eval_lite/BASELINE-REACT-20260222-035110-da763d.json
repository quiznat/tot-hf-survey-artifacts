    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 0, 7, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum is 9750. Let's verify if 9750 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2? 9750 ends in 0 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3? Sum of digits = 9 + 7 + 5 + 0 = 21, and 21 is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 9750 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 9750. But to be thorough,",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle claims the maximum is 9750. We verified that 9750 uses all digits [9,0,7,5] exactly once, ends in 0 (so divisible by 2), and digit sum is 21 (divisible by 3), hence divisible by 6. Since it's the largest possible permutation (9750 > 9705 > 9570, etc.) and satisfies divisibility, it must be the answer. We can confirm via best_divisible to be safe, but given the oracle and verification, it's sufficient. However, to strictly follow ReAct, we should validate with tools if needed. Let's use is_divisible on 9750 with divisor 6 to double-check.\nACTION: is_divisible 9750 6",
