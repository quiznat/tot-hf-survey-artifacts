    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 5360. Let's verify if 5360 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 5360, last two digits are 60, and 60 \u00f7 4 = 15 \u2192 divisible. So 5360 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says max is 5360, and it's valid, the answer is likely 5360. But to be thorough, maybe I should confirm using the tools. Let's use `is_divisible` to verify 5360 is divisible by",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible number is 5360. To confirm it's valid, I need to check if 5360 is divisible by 4. As noted, divisibility by 4 depends on the last two digits: 60 \u00f7 4 = 15, so yes, 5360 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says 5360 is the maximum, and it satisfies the divisibility condition, the answer is 5360. However, to follow the ReAct protocol and ensure correctness, I should verify using the `is_divisible` tool before concluding.\nACTION: is_divisible 5360 4",
