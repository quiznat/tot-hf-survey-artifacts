    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 5, 2, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum such number is 8325. Let's verify if 8325 is indeed divisible by 5 and uses all the digits.  \n- Digits in 8325: 8, 3, 2, 5 \u2014 matches the given digits.  \n- Divisibility by 5: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Here, last digit is 5 \u2192 divisible by 5.  \nSo 8325 is valid. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 8325. But to be thorough, let's confirm using the tools",
