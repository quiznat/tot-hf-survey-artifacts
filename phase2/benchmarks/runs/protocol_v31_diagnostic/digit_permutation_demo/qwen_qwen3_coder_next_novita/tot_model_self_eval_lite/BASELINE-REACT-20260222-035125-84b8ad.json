    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle_max is 6312 (which suggests the maximum possible permutation is 6321, but 6312 is given as a reference). We need to find the largest permutation of [3,1,6,2] divisible by 4.\n\nRecall: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n\nAll permutations of [3,1,6,2] (sorted descending): 6321, 6312, 6231, 6213, 6132, 6123, 3621, 3612, 3261,",
