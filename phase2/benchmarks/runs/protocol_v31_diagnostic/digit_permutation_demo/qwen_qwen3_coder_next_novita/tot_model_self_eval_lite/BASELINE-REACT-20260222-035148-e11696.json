    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible such number is 9965. Let's verify if 9965 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 9965 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, 9965 uses digits 9, 9, 6, 5 \u2014 exactly the given digits. So 9965 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, we can conclude the answer is 9965. But to be thorough, let's confirm using the tools: first check if 996",
