Let's verify if 6300 is achievable and divisible by 6.\n\nDigits available: 3, 0, 6, 0 \u2192 we can form numbers like 6300, 6030, 3600, 3060, etc.\n\nCheck 6300:\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit is 0 \u2192 yes.\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits = 6 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 9 \u2192 divisible by 3.\n\u2192 So 6300 is divisible by 6.\n\nSince oracle_max",
