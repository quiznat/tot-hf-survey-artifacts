    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 2] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 9420, which suggests that 9420 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and divisible by 6). Let's verify:  \n- A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 0, 2, 4, or 6, 8 \u2014 here possible last digits are 0, 2, 4.  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 15, which is divisible by",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 = 15, which is divisible by 3, so any permutation ending in an even digit (0, 2, or 4) will be divisible by 6. The largest possible permutation is 9420 (ends in 0, even), and the oracle confirms it's the max. To be thorough, I should verify that 9420 is divisible by 6 using the is_divisible tool.  \nACTION: is_divisible 9420 6",
