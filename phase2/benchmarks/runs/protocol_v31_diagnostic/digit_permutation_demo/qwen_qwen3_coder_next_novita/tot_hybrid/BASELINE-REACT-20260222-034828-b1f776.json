    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 0, 9, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and we are told the oracle_max is 9650. Let's verify if 9650 is valid: digits of 9650 are [9,6,5,0] \u2014 matches the given digits [6,0,9,5] (just reordered). Is 9650 divisible by 5? A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 9650 ends in 0 \u2192 yes. So 9650 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle_max is given as 9650, and it satisfies the constraints, it's likely the answer. But to be thorough, let's confirm using tools if",

It ends in 0, so it's divisible by 5. Since it's the maximum possible permutation (9650 is the largest arrangement of those digits ending in 0 or 5 \u2014 next candidate would be 9605, which ends in 5 but is smaller), and the oracle confirms it's the max, we can trust it. However, to follow the ReAct protocol rigorously, we should use the tools to confirm divisibility and/or that no larger valid number exists. Let's first check if 9650 is divisible by 5 using is_divisible.\nACTION: is_divisible",
