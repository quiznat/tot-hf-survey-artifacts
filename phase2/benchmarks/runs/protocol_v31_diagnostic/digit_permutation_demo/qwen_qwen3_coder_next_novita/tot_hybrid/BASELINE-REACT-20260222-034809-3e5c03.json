    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 2, 3, 2] that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum is 5322. Let's verify if 5322 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. For divisibility by 2: last digit is 2 \u2192 even \u2192 OK. For divisibility by 3: sum of digits = 5+2+3+2 = 12, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 OK. So 5322 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should be 5322. But to follow the ReAct loop, maybe I should confirm using the tools. Let's use",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle claims the maximum valid number is 5322. I need to verify it using the available tools. First, check if 5322 is divisible by 6 using the `is_divisible` tool. If it returns true, and since it's the oracle's maximum, it's likely the correct answer. However, to be thorough and follow the ReAct protocol, I should call `is_divisible` with input 5322 and divisor 6.\nACTION: is_divisible 5322",
