    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 5360. Let's verify if 5360 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 5360, last two digits are 60, and 60 \u00f7 4 = 15 \u2192 divisible. So 5360 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says max is 5360, and it's valid, the answer is likely 5360. But to be thorough, let's confirm using the tools if needed. However, since the oracle gives the max and we can verify divisibility, we can",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible number is 5360. We verified that 5360 uses all digits [5, 6, 0, 3] exactly once and is divisible by 4 (since 60 is divisible by 4). To be rigorous, we should confirm using the `is_divisible` tool that 5360 is indeed divisible by 4, and optionally check that no larger permutation exists \u2014 but since the oracle guarantees 5360 is the maximum, and it satisfies the divisibility condition, it must be the answer. Still, using `is_divisible` adds verification.\nACTION: is_divisible 5360 4",
