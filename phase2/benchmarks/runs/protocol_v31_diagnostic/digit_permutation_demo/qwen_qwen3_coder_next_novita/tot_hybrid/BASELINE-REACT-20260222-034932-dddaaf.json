    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [8, 2, 3, 1] and is divisible by 8, with the oracle indicating the maximum possible such number is 8312. I need to verify or find this using the available tools: `best_divisible` and `is_divisible`. Since `oracle_max` is given as 8312, and it's likely the correct answer, I should verify if 8312 is divisible by 8 using `is_divisible`. If it is, then that's the answer. If not, I'd need to use `best_divisible` to find the correct maximum.\n\nLet me first check if 8312 is divisible by 8.

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: To verify if 8312 is the correct answer, I need to check if it's divisible by 8. The divisibility rule for 8 states that a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 8312, the last three digits are 312. 312 \u00f7 8 = 39, which is an integer, so 312 is divisible by 8, and thus 8312 is divisible by 8. Since 8312 is formed from the digits [8, 2, 3, 1] and is divisible by 8, and the oracle says it's the maximum, I should confirm using the `is_divisible` tool to be thorough.\nACTION: is_divisible 8312 8",
