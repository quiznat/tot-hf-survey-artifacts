    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [3, 5, 6, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 5536. Let's verify if 5536 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 5536, last three digits are 536. 536 \u00f7 8 = 67, so yes, 536 is divisible by 8, so 5536 is divisible by 8. Now, check if 5536 can be formed from digits [3,5,6,5]: digits of 5536 are [5,5,3,6] \u2014 matches the multiset [",
