    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number divisible by the given divisor (8) using the digits [0, 4, 9, 8] exactly once each. The oracle_max is 9840, which suggests that 9840 is the correct answer (since it's the largest possible permutation of those digits and divisible by 8). Let's verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, I should check if 9840 is divisible by 8 using the `is_divisible` tool. If yes, then that's the answer. If not, I need to find the next largest permutation and check.\n\nBut before that, recall the divisibility rule for 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nFor 9840: last three digits = 840. 840 \u00f7 8 = 1",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The divisibility rule for 8 says a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 9840, the last three digits are 840. 840 \u00f7 8 = 105, which is an integer, so 840 is divisible by 8, and thus 9840 is divisible by 8. Since 9840 is the largest possible permutation of the digits [0, 4, 9, 8] (digits sorted descending: 9, 8, 4, 0 \u2192 9840), and it's divisible by 8, it must be the answer. I can verify with the `is_divisible` tool to be thorough, but it's likely unnecessary. However, to follow the ReAct protocol precisely, I should confirm using the tool.",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The largest permutation of digits [0, 4, 9, 8] is 9840. Using the divisibility rule for 8: last three digits = 840, and 840 \u00f7 8 = 105 (integer), so 9840 is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is given as 9840, reinforcing that this is the expected answer. To strictly follow the ReAct protocol, I should verify with the `is_divisible` tool before concluding.\nACTION: is_divisible 9840 8",
