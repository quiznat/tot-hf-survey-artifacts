    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [7, 2, 4, 5] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 7542, which is likely the largest permutation (7542), but we need to verify if it's divisible by 6. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation that is divisible by 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits from [7,2,4,5] are 2 or 4.\n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 7+2+4+5 = 18, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 all",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 18, divisible by 3, so all permutations are divisible by 3. For divisibility by 6, we also need the number to be even \u2192 last digit must be 2 or 4. The largest permutation is 7542 (ends with 2, even), so it's divisible by both 2 and 3 \u2192 divisible by 6. Since 7542 is the largest possible permutation and it's divisible by 6, it must be the answer. Let's verify using the is_divisible tool to be safe.",
