    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [2, 4, 8, 1] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8, and we are told the oracle_max is 4128. However, 4128 uses digits 4,1,2,8 \u2014 which matches our digits \u2014 and 4128 \u00f7 8 = 516, so it is divisible by 8. Let's verify if 4128 is indeed the maximum possible such number.\n\nFirst, sort digits descending: [8,4,2,1] \u2192 8421. Check if divisible by 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. Last three digits of 8421: 421 \u2192 421 \u00f7",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: To check divisibility by 8, only the last three digits matter. For 8421, last three digits are 421. Compute 421 \u00f7 8 = 52.625 \u2192 not divisible. So 8421 is not valid. Next, try permutations in descending order to find the largest valid one. Since oracle_max is given as 4128, and it uses the correct digits and is divisible by 8 (4128 \u00f7 8 = 516), we should verify if any larger permutation than 4128 using [2,4,8,1] is divisible by 8.\n\nAll permutations larger than 4128 would start with 8 or 41 followed by digits >12 (since 4128 starts with 4,1,2,8). Let's list",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: To find the largest number formed by digits [2,4,8,1] divisible by 8, we can use the divisibility rule: a number is divisible by 8 iff its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. Since oracle_max = 4128 is given and uses all digits exactly once, and 4128 \u00f7 8 = 516 (integer), it is divisible by 8. Now, check if any permutation larger than 4128 is divisible by 8.\n\nPermutations larger than 4128 must be \u2265 4218, 4281, 4812, 4821, 8xxx (all starting with 8 are > 4128).
