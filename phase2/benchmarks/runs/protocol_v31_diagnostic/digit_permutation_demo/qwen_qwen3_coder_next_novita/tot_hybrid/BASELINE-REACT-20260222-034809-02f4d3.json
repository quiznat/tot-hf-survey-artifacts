    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 8, 4, 6] that is divisible by 3, and we know the oracle says the maximum possible is 8664. Let's verify if 8664 is divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Digits of 8664: 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 24, and 24 is divisible by 3, so 8664 is divisible by 3. Also, 8664 uses exactly the digits [6, 8, 4, 6] (two 6s, one 8, one 4), and it's the largest possible arrangement (descending order: 8,6,6,4). So",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is 8664, and we verified that 8664 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits = 24, divisible by 3), and uses exactly the given digits [6,8,4,6]. Since it's the largest permutation of those digits (8664), and it satisfies divisibility, it must be the answer. We can confirm using the is_divisible tool to be thorough, but it's redundant here. Still, to follow ReAct rigor, let's verify with the tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 8664 3",
