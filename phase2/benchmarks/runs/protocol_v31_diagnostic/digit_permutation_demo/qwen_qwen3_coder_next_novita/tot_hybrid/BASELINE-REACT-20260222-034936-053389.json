    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 8, 8, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 5488, which suggests the maximum possible number from these digits is 8854, but 5488 is likely the largest *divisible* candidate or an upper bound. Let's analyze.\n\nFirst, list all permutations of [5, 8, 8, 4] in descending order and check divisibility by 7, starting from the largest.\n\nDigits sorted descending: [8, 8, 5, 4] \u2192 8854  \nNext: [8, 8, 4, 5] \u2192 8845  \nThen: [8, 5, 8, 4] \u2192 858",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number formed by permuting digits [5, 8, 8, 4] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is 5488, which is suspiciously *smaller* than many permutations (e.g., 8854), so perhaps 5488 is the *answer* (i.e., the largest divisible number), but we must verify it's constructible from the digits and divisible by 7. Let's check: digits of 5488 are [5, 4, 8, 8] \u2014 exactly our multiset! So 5488 is a valid permutation. Now check if it's divisible by 7: 5488 \u00f7 7 = 784, since 7\u00d7784 = 5488 (7\u00d7700=4",
