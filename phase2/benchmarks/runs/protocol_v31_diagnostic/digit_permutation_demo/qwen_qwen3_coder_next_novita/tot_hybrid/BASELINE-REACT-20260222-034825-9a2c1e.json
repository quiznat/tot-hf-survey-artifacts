    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 3, 8, 8] that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 8538. Let's verify if 8538 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. For divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2014 8 is even, so OK. For divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3 \u2014 8+5+3+8 = 24, and 24 \u00f7 3 = 8, so yes. So 8538 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says max is 8538, and it's valid, the answer should be 8538. But to",
