    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 7, 2] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9732. Let's verify if 9732 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9732, last two digits are 32, and 32 \u00f7 4 = 8 \u2192 divisible. So 9732 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says max is 9732, and it's valid, the answer is likely 9732. But to be thorough, maybe I should confirm using the tools. Let's use `is_divisible` to verify 9732 is divisible by",
