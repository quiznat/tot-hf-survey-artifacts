    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 3, 8, 8] that is divisible by 6, and we are told the oracle_max is 8538. Let's recall: a number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 8, 8 (only even digits available are 8s).  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 any permutation will satisfy divisibility by 3.  \nSo we only need to ensure the number ends in 8, and is as large as possible.  \nTo maximize the number,",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: To maximize the number formed by digits [5, 3, 8, 8] ending in 8 (for divisibility by 2), we should arrange the remaining digits [5, 3, 8] in descending order before the final 8. Descending order of [5, 3, 8] is [8, 5, 3], so candidate number is 8538. Since oracle_max = 8538, and 8538 ends in 8 (even), sum = 24 (divisible by 3), so it's divisible by 6. Let's verify with is_divisible to be safe.",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: We have deduced that 8538 is the largest permutation ending in 8 (ensuring divisibility by 2), and since the digit sum is 24 (divisible by 3), it must be divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 8538, which strongly suggests this is the correct answer. To be thorough, we should verify using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 8538 6",
