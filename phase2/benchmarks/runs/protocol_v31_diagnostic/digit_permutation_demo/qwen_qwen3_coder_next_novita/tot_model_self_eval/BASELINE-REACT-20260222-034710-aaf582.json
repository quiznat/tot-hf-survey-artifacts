    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed from the digits [9, 7, 6, 2] that is divisible by 3, and we're told the oracle_max is 9762. Let's verify if 9762 is divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Sum of digits: 9 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 24, and 24 is divisible by 3, so 9762 is divisible by 3. Since 9762 is the largest possible permutation of those digits (digits sorted descending: 9,7,6,2 \u2192 9762), and it's divisible by 3, it must be the answer. But to be thorough, let's confirm using the tools. First, I can use",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of digits is 9+7+6+2 = 24, which is divisible by 3, so any permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3. Therefore, the largest permutation \u2014 which is 9762 \u2014 is divisible by 3. Since the oracle_max is given as 9762 and it's the maximum possible number from the digits, and it's divisible by 3, it must be the correct answer. I can verify with the is_divisible tool to be safe, but logically it's confirmed. Let's use the tool to confirm.\nACTION: is_divisible 9762 3",
