    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 2] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is 9420, which is the maximum possible number from those digits (9,4,2,0 arranged descending). We need to check divisibility by 6, which requires divisibility by both 2 and 3.\n\nDivisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 0, 2, 4 (since digits are [9,4,0,2]).\n\nDivisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9+4+0+2 = 15, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 any permutation is divisible by 3.\n\nSo we only need to ensure the number is even (",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Since the sum of digits is 15 (divisible by 3), any permutation is divisible by 3. For divisibility by 6, we need the number to be even, i.e., end in 0, 2, or 4. The largest possible number is 9420 (ends in 0), which is even and divisible by 3 \u2192 thus divisible by 6. Since 9420 is the maximum permutation and satisfies divisibility by 6, it must be the answer. Let's verify with the oracle_max: it's given as 9420, and we suspect it's divisible by 6. Use is_divisible to confirm.",

The largest permutation is 9420, ending in 0 (even), so it is divisible by both 2 and 3, hence by 6.
