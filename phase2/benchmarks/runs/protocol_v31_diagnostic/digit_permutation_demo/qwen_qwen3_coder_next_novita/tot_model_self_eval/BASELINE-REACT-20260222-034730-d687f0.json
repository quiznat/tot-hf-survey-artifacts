    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9965. Let's verify and reason.\n\nFirst, a number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5. The available digits are [6, 9, 9, 5] \u2014 no 0, so the only possible last digit for divisibility by 5 is 5.\n\nSo the number must end in 5. Then the remaining digits to arrange are [6, 9, 9]. To maximize the number, we want the largest possible prefix \u2014 so arrange [6, 9, 9] in descending order: 9, 9, 6 \u2192 996. So the full number is",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The reasoning so far shows that to form the largest number divisible by 5 using digits [6, 9, 9, 5], the number must end in 5 (since no 0 is available). Then the remaining digits [6, 9, 9] should be arranged in descending order to maximize the number: 9965. The oracle says the maximum is 9965, which matches our construction. Now we should verify that 9965 is indeed divisible by 5 using the `is_divisible` tool.",
