    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 9, 8, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9888. Let's verify if 9888 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2: last digit is 8 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits = 9 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 33 \u2192 33 is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 9888 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says max is 9888, and it's valid, the answer should be 9888. Let's confirm using the tool",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible is 9888. I verified that 9888 is divisible by 6 (ends in 8 \u2192 divisible by 2; digit sum 33 \u2192 divisible by 3). Since it's valid and matches the oracle's max, it must be the answer. I can confirm using `is_divisible` to be thorough.\nACTION: is_divisible 9888 6",
