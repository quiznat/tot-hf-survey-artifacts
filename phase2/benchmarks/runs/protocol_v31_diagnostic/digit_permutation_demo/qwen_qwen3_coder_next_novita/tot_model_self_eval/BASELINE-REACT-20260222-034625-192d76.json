    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9636. Let's verify if 9636 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9636, the last two digits are 36. Since 36 \u00f7 4 = 9, 36 is divisible by 4, so 9636 is divisible by 4. Also, 9636 uses digits [9,6,3,6] \u2014 which matches the available digits [9,3,6,6]. So 9636 is valid. Since the oracle_max is 9636 and it's divisible by",
