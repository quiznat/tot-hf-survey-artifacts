    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 2, 4, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max is given as 2443, which suggests that the maximum possible number from the digits is 4432, but the largest *divisible* number is claimed to be 2443. However, 2443 uses digits [2, 4, 4, 3] \u2014 same multiset \u2014 so it's a candidate. Let's verify if 2443 is divisible by 7. Also, we should check if there's a larger valid permutation divisible by 7.\n\nFirst, list permutations of [3,2,4,4] in descending order and check divisibility.\n\nAll permutations (sorted descending):\n- 4432\n- 4",

The oracle_max is 2443, which is suspicious because 2443 < 4432 (the max possible number), so either 2443 is the largest divisible one, or the oracle is misleading. Let\u2019s verify using tools. First, check if 4432 is divisible by 7 using `is_divisible`. If not, try next largest permutations descending. But better: use `best_divisible` if it's designed to find the max divisible number directly \u2014 but we need to confirm its usage. Since `best_divisible` likely takes digits and divisor, let's try that first as it's more efficient. However, instructions don\u2019t specify tool signatures.

To verify correctness efficiently, I should first try `best_divisible` if it's designed to return the maximum divisible number given digits and divisor. Since that's likely the intended tool for this benchmark, I'll use it directly. If it fails or returns something unexpected, I'll fall back to checking permutations manually using `is_divisible`.
