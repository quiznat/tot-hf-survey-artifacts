    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 2, 0, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 7, and the oracle says the maximum possible such number is 8204. Let's verify if 8204 is indeed divisible by 7 and uses all the digits.  \nFirst, check if 8204 uses digits [4, 2, 0, 8] \u2014 yes: digits are 8, 2, 0, 4 \u2014 matches.  \nNow, check divisibility by 7: 8204 \u00f7 7 = ?  \nCompute: 7 \u00d7 1172 = 8204?
