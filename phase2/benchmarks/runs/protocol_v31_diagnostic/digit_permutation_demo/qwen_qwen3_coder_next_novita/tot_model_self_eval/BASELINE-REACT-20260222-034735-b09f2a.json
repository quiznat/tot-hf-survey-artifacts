    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 4, 9, 8] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is given as 9840, which suggests that 9840 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation of those digits and divisible by 8). But I should verify using the tools.\n\nFirst, I can check if 9840 is divisible by 8 using `is_divisible`. If yes, and it's the largest permutation (which it is, since digits sorted descending: 9,8,4,0 \u2192 9840), then that's the answer.\n\nLet me verify divisibility by 8: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.

Since 9840 is the largest permutation of digits [0,4,9,8] (descending order: 9,8,4,0), and it's divisible by 8, it must be the answer. I can confirm using `is_divisible` to be thorough, but it's likely unnecessary. However, to follow the ReAct protocol and use tools as instructed, I should verify with `is_divisible`.
