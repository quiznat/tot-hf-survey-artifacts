Let's verify if 7535 is divisible by 11 using the is_divisible tool. If it is, then that's the answer.

Let me re-evaluate: The task is to find the largest number formed by digits [7,5,3,5] divisible by 11, and oracle says max is 7535. First, check if 7535 is divisible by 11. The divisibility rule for 11: (sum of digits in odd positions) \u2212 (sum of digits in even positions) must be a multiple of 11 (including 0). For 7535: positions (from left, 1-indexed): 7 (1), 5 (2), 3 (3), 5 (4). Odd positions: 7 + 3 = 10; even positions: 5 + 5 = 10; difference = 0 \u2192 divisible by",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The divisibility rule for 11 gives a difference of 0 (10 \u2212 10), which is divisible by 11, so 7535 is divisible by 11. Since the oracle states the maximum possible such number is 7535, and it satisfies divisibility, this must be the answer. No further tool calls are needed.",
