    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [2, 5, 6, 6], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, the most common interpretation for such tasks is to use the numbers to reach 24 using arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses). This is the classic \"24 game\". Let's try to find a way to combine 2, 5, 6, 6 to make 24.\n\nPossible approaches:\n- Try (6 + 6) \u00d7 (5 \u2212 2) = 12 \u00d7 3 = 36 \u2192 too high.\n- Try 6 \u00d7 5 \u2212 6 \u00f7 2 = 30 \u2212 3 = 27 \u2192 too high.\n- Try 6 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 2) + 6 =",

That works: 6 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 2) + 6 = 24.  \nWe used all numbers: 6, 5, 2, 6 \u2014 each exactly once.  \nNow we can verify with the calc tool.  \nACTION: calc 6 * (5 - 2) + 6",
