    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [4, 5, 8, 8], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., \"make 24\"), I need to infer the likely objective \u2014 a common benchmark is the 24 Game, where you use all numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to reach 24.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find an expression using 4, 5, 8, 8 that equals 24.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 8 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 4/8) = 8 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 0.5) = 8 \u00d7 4.5 = 36 \u2192 too high.\n- (8 + 8) + (5 \u2212 4) = 16 + 1 = 1",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's continue exploring combinations for 24. Try using multiplication and subtraction:  \n- (8 \u00d7 4) \u2212 (8 \u2212 5) = 32 \u2212 3 = 29  \n- (8 + 4) \u00d7 (8 \u2212 5) = 12 \u00d7 3 = 36  \n- 8 \u00d7 (8 \u2212 5) = 24 \u2014 but that uses only three numbers (8, 8, 5), missing 4. Need all four.  \n- Try: (8 \u00d7 5) \u2212 (8 + 4) = 40 \u2212 12 = 28  \n- How about: (8 + 8) \u00d7 (5 \u2212 4) = 16 \u00d7 1 = 16  \n- Try division: 8 / (5 \u2212 4) = 8, then 8 + 8",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The error suggests the tool doesn\u2019t accept `-` as a valid operator \u2014 perhaps only `+`, `*`, `/`, and parentheses are allowed, or the tool expects a specific format. Let\u2019s re-express attempts using only allowed operations. Since the tool is `calc`, it likely supports standard arithmetic. The error may be due to a syntax issue (e.g., missing spaces or invalid characters). Let\u2019s try a valid expression: e.g., `8 * (5 - 4/8)` \u2014 but earlier that gave 36, not 24.\n\nWait \u2014 try: `(8 - 4) * (8 - 5) = 4 * 3 = 12` \u2014 too low.\n\nWhat about: `8 * (8 - 5) + 0` \u2014 but need to incorporate 4 meaningfully.\n\nAlternative idea: `(8 * 4) - (8 + 5",
