    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [5, 6, 6, 10] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer what the goal might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing sum, product, average, or checking for some property (e.g., can we make 24 using arithmetic operations?). Given the numbers [5, 6, 6, 10], a classic 24 game variant is plausible.\n\nLet me try to see if these numbers can be combined to make 24. Try:  \n6 \u00d7 5 = 30; 30 - 6 = 24; 24 \u00d7 (10/10) = 24 \u2014 but we only have one 10.  \nAlternatively: (10 - 6) = 4;",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [5, 6, 6, 10], and the goal is likely to use arithmetic operations to reach 24 (classic 24 game). Let\u2019s explore combinations:  \n- 6 \u00d7 5 = 30; 30 - 6 = 24; then we still have 10 unused \u2014 not valid unless all numbers must be used.  \n- Try (10 + 6 + 6 + 5) = 27 \u2014 too high.  \n- (10 - 6) = 4; 6 \u00d7 5 = 30; 30 - 4 = 26 \u2014 no.  \n- (6 + 6) = 12; 10 + 5 = 15; 12 + 15 = 27.  \n- (6 \u00d7 6) =",

Known 24 solutions often involve factoring 24: e.g., 4\u00d76, 3\u00d78, 12\u00d72, etc. Try to form such components.\n\nObserve:  \n- 10 \u2212 6 = 4  \n- 6 \u2212 5 = 1  \nThen 4 \u00d7 6 = 24, but we\u2019d need to use the remaining 6 and 5. Wait \u2014 if we do (10 \u2212 6) = 4, and (6 \u2212 5) = 1, then 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 uses only three numbers. Not valid unless all must be used.\n\nTry: (6 \u00d7",

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: Let me try a more structured approach. We need to use all four numbers [5, 6, 6, 10] exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to get 24.\n\nTry:  \n(6 \u00d7 5) = 30  \n30 \u2212 6 = 24 \u2014 but 10 is unused.  \nWhat if we incorporate 10 via division by 1? e.g., \u00d7 (10/10) = \u00d71, but only one 10.\n\nAlternative idea: (10 \u00d7 6) = 60; 60 \u00f7 (6 \u2212 5) = 60 \u00f7 1 = 60 \u2014 too big.  \n(10 + 6) = 16; 16 + 6 + 5 = 27.  \n(10 \u00d7",

    "STEP 5 MODEL: THINK: Let me try a different angle. Maybe the task isn\u2019t 24-game but something simpler like computing the sum, product, or average. Given the input [5, 6, 6, 10], sum = 5 + 6 + 6 + 10 = 27. Product = 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 10 = 1800. Average = 27 / 4 = 6.75. Since the only available tool is `calc`, and no specific operation is given, the most straightforward benchmark task with a list of numbers is to compute their sum. Let me verify with `calc`.",
