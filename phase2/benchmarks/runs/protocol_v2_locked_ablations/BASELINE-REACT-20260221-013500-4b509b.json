    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 4, 4, 5]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer what might be expected. Common benchmark tasks with lists include computing the sum, average, product, or perhaps checking for duplicates. Given the presence of duplicate 4s, maybe the task is to compute the sum or average. Let me compute the sum first using the calc tool.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 4 + 4 + 5",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the list [2, 4, 4, 5] is 15. However, since the task wasn't explicitly specified, I should consider other common interpretations. For example, the average would be 15 / 4 = 3.75. But without more context, sum is a reasonable first interpretation. Since the calc tool successfully returned 15, and no further instructions were given, I'll assume the task was to compute the sum. I'll now provide the final answer.\nFINAL: 15"
