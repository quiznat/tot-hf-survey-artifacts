    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [4, 4, 4, 10] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to combine the numbers [4, 4, 4, 10] using arithmetic operations to reach a target (commonly 24 in \"24 game\" puzzles). Let\u2019s test if that\u2019s the case.\n\nWe have three 4s and a 10. Try combinations:\n\n- 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22 \u2192 too low  \n- 4 \u00d7 4 + 4 + 10 = 16 + 4 + 10 = 30  \n- 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22  \n- (10 - 4) \u00d7",

We tried sums and simple products; need more creative grouping. Try: (10 \u2212 4) \u00d7 4 \u2212 4 = 6 \u00d7 4 \u2212 4 = 24 \u2212 4 = 20 \u2192 no. (10 + 4) + (4 + 4) = 18 + 8 = 26.

Compute: 4/4 = 1, so 10 \u2212 1 = 9, 9 \u00d7 4 = 36 \u2014 too high. Try (4 + 4) \u00d7 (10 \u2212 4) = 8 \u00d7 6 = 48 \u2014 too high. Try (10 \u00d7 4 \u2212 4) \u2212 4 = 40 \u2212 4 \u2212 4 = 32. How about (4 \u00d7 10) \u2212 (4 \u00d7 4) = 40 \u2212 16 = 24! Yes! That works: 4 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 \u00d7 4 = 40 \u2212 16 =",
