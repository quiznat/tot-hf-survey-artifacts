    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop with input [3, 3, 4, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to combine the numbers [3, 3, 4, 7] using arithmetic operations to reach a target (e.g., 24 game). Common targets are 24, so let\u2019s try to reach 24.\n\nAvailable numbers: 3, 3, 4, 7  \nTry combinations:  \n- 7 - 3 = 4 \u2192 now have 4, 4, 3 \u2192 4 \u00d7 4 = 16, 16 + 3 = 19 \u2192 no  \n- (7 + 3) \u00d7 (4 - 3) = 10 \u00d7 1 = 10  \n- 7",

Try:  \n- 7 \u00d7 3 = 21, need +3 \u2192 21 + 3 = 24, but we have two 3s and a 4 \u2014 wait, that uses 7 and one 3, leaving 3 and 4 unused.
