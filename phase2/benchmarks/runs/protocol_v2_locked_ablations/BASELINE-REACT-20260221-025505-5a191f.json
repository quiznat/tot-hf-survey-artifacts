    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [2, 2, 6, 6], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the numbers [2, 2, 6, 6] with arithmetic operations to reach 24. Let me try combinations.\n\nFirst, note: 6 \u00d7 2 = 12, and 6 \u00d7 2 = 12, so 12 + 12 = 24. That works: 6 \u00d7 2 + 6 \u00d7 2 = 24. But we need to use the numbers exactly once each: [2, 2, 6, 6] \u2014 yes, that uses both 2s and both 6s.\n\nAlternatively, (6 + 6) \u00d7 (2) =",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to use the numbers [2, 2, 6, 6] with arithmetic operations to reach 24. A valid expression is 6 \u00d7 2 + 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 + 12 = 24, which uses all numbers exactly once. To confirm via the `calc` tool, I should evaluate this expression. However, `calc` likely expects a single expression string. I'll compute step-by-step: first compute 6*2, then 6*2, then sum \u2014 but better to input the full expression: `6*2+6*2`. Let me verify with `calc`.\nACTION: calc 6*2+6*2",
