    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop, with input [4, 7, 9, 10] and only the calc tool available. Since no specific operation or goal is given, I need to infer what might be expected. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing sum, product, average, or checking properties. Given the tools constraint, calc can perform arithmetic. Let me try computing the sum first as a baseline.  \nACTION: calc 4 + 7 + 9 + 10  \nScratchpad:",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 30",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the numbers [4, 7, 9, 10] is 30, as computed. However, the task is a benchmark task without explicit instructions, so other interpretations are possible (e.g., average, product, max, min, or even a specific sequence property). Since only one step has been performed and no further guidance is given, I should consider whether this is sufficient or if more is expected. In many benchmark contexts involving lists and a calculator tool, computing the sum is a standard first step. Given the simplicity and correctness of the sum, and no indication of a different goal, I'll conclude with the sum as the answer.  \nFINAL: 30"
