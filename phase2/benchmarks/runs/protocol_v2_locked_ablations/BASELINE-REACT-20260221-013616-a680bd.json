    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [4, 4, 4, 9], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the numbers [4, 4, 4, 9] with arithmetic operations to reach 24 (a common benchmark). Let's explore possible combinations.\n\nWe have three 4s and one 9.\n\nTry:  \n- 9 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21 \u2192 too low  \n- 9 \u00d7 4 - 4 - 4 = 36 - 8 = 28 \u2192 too high  \n- 9 \u00d7 (4 - 4/4) = 9 \u00d7 (4 - 1) = 9 \u00d7 3 = 27  \n- (9 - 4) \u00d7",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's continue exploring combinations. We need to reach 24 using [4, 4, 4, 9]. Try factoring: 24 = 6 \u00d7 4, 8 \u00d7 3, 12 \u00d7 2, etc. With three 4s, maybe (4 + 4 + 4) = 12, and 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 \u2014 but we don\u2019t have a 2. Can we make 2 from 9? 9 - 7? Not helpful. Alternatively, 9 + 15 = 24 \u2014 can we make 15 from three 4s? 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, 4 \u00d7 4 - 4 = 12, 4 \u00d7 (4 - 4/4) = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12... Hmm",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Let's try more structured approaches. 24 = 9 + 15, and 15 = 4 \u00d7 4 - 4/4? Wait, we only have three 4s, not four. But we have exactly three 4s and one 9. Try: (9 - 4/4) \u00d7 4 = (9 - 1) \u00d7 4 = 8 \u00d7 4 = 32 \u2014 too high. (9 + 4/4) \u00d7 ? = 10 \u00d7 ? \u2014 need 2.4, not helpful. Try division: 9 / (4/4) = 9, then +4+4+4? Already tried.

    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: Let's try a more systematic approach. We need to use exactly [4, 4, 4, 9] with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to get 24. Try using multiplication as the main operation. Note that 24 = 6 \u00d7 4. Can we get 6 from [4, 4, 9]? 9 \u2212 4 \u2212 4/2? No 2. Alternatively, 24 = 8 \u00d7 3. Can we get 8 and 3? 4 + 4 = 8, and 9 \u00f7 3 = 3 \u2014 but no 3. Wait: 9 \u2212 4 \u2212 4 = 1, not helpful. Try: (9 \u00d7 4) \u2212 (4 + 4) = 36 \u2212 8 = 28. Too high. (9 +",
    "STEP 4 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 5 MODEL: THINK: Let's try a different angle. Consider using division to create fractions that combine nicely. For example, 4 / 4 = 1, so 9 \u2212 1 = 8, and 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 but we need a 3. Can we get 3 from the remaining 4? Not directly. Wait \u2014 what if we do (4 + 4 + 4) = 12, and 12 \u00d7 2 = 24. Can we get 2 from 9? 9 / 4.5 = 2, but no 4.5. Alternatively, (9 \u00d7 4) \u2212 (4 \u00d7 3) = 36 \u2212 12 = 24 \u2014 but we don\u2019t have a 3. Hmm.\n\nWait \u2014 try: (9 \u2212 4/4) \u00d7 ? = 8 \u00d7 ? \u2014",
