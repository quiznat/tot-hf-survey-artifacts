    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 4, 8, 10]. The available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with number sequences include finding the sum, product, average, or identifying a pattern. Let me compute the sum first, as it's straightforward and often a default.\n\nSum = 2 + 4 + 8 + 10 = 24.\n\nI'll use the `calc` tool to verify this calculation.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 4 + 8 + 10",
