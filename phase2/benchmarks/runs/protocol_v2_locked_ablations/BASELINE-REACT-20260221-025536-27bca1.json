    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [1, 1, 2, 7]. I need to determine what the benchmark task is asking for. Since only the `calc` tool is available, it likely involves performing some arithmetic operation (e.g., sum, product, or forming an expression to reach a target). Common benchmark tasks with 4 numbers involve the \"24 game\" \u2014 using all numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24.\n\nLet me test if [1, 1, 2, 7] can make 24.\n\nTry:  \n(7 \u2212 1) \u00d7 (2 + 1) = 6 \u00d7 3 = 18 \u2192 too low  \n(7 + 1) \u00d7 (2 + 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2192 yes! But we have two 1",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The list is [1, 1, 2, 7]. In the 24 game, we must use all numbers exactly once. My earlier attempt (7 + 1) \u00d7 (2 + 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 uses only one 1, but we have two 1s. So that's invalid. Let\u2019s try other combinations.\n\nTry: (7 \u2212 1) \u00d7 (2 + 1) = 6 \u00d7 3 = 18 \u2014 still only one 1 used? No, (2 + 1) uses one 1, and (7 \u2212 1) uses the other 1 \u2014 yes! That\u2019s both 1s, plus 2 and 7. Wait: (7 \u2212 1) uses one 1, (2 + 1) uses the other 1 \u2014 correct. So (7 \u2212 1",

I mistakenly thought (7 + 1) \u00d7 (2 + 1) = 24, but that uses only one 1 in each group \u2014 actually, (7 + 1) uses one 1, (2 + 1) uses the second 1 \u2014 so both 1s are used. Wait: (7 + 1) \u00d7 (2 + 1) = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, and uses numbers 7, 1, 2, 1 \u2014 exactly [1, 1, 2, 7]. Yes! So the expression is valid. Let me confirm with calc: (7 + 1) * (2 + 1) = 8",
