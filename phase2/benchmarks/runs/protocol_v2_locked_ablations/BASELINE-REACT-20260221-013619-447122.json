    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [4, 5, 5, 7]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer what to do.

However, the task is still ambiguous \u2014 it could be asking for sum, average, product, median, mode, etc. Since the input contains duplicates (two 5s), maybe the task is to compute the mode (most frequent value), which is 5. Alternatively, average = 21 / 4 = 5.25. But without explicit instructions, I should consider common benchmark patterns. In many coding/ML benchmarks, given a list like this, tasks often involve computing the sum, average, or checking for duplicates. Since I already computed the sum, and the average is straightforward, perhaps the intended task is the average. Let me compute the average using calc.\n\nACTION: calc 21 / 4\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: 5.25\nTHINK: The average",
