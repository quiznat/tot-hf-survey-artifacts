    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to process the input list [1, 1, 4, 8] using available tools. The only tool available is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since no specific operation is given, a common benchmark task with such inputs is to compute the sum, product, or perhaps find a pattern. Let\u2019s consider possible interpretations:\n\n- Sum: 1 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 14  \n- Product: 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 8 = 32  \n- Maybe it's about powers or combinations: 1, 1, 4=2\u00b2, 8=2\u00b3 \u2014 could be powers of 2 starting from 2\u2070? But first two are 1, which is 2\u2070 and 2\u2070 again, not standard.\n\nAnother idea: maybe it's a sequence where each term is derived from previous ones",
