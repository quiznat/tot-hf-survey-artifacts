    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [3, 3, 4, 7], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style problem: using the numbers [3, 3, 4, 7] and basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses), form an expression that evaluates to 24. Let me try to find such an expression.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations:\n- 7 \u00d7 3 = 21, need +3 \u2192 but we have two 3s and a 4. 21 + 3 = 24, but then 4 is unused.\n- Try (7 \u2212 3) \u00d7 (7 \u2212 3) = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 \u2014 nope, only one 7.\n- Try 3 \u00d7 7",

Try 7 \u00d7 3 = 21, remaining [3, 4]; 21 + 3 = 24, but 4 unused. What if we do (7 \u2212 3/3) \u00d7 4? Compute 3/3 = 1, 7 \u2212 1 = 6, 6 \u00d7 4 = 24! Yes! That uses all numbers: 3, 3, 4, 7.
