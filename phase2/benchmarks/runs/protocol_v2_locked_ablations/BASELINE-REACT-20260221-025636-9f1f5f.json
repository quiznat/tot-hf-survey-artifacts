    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [1, 1, 4, 8]. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the four numbers (each exactly once) and basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to make 24. Let me try to find such an expression.\n\nNumbers: 1, 1, 4, 8.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 8 \u00d7 4 = 32; 32 \u2212 (1 + 1) = 30 \u2192 too high.\n- 8 \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 24, but we have two 1s, so (4 \u2212 1) = 3, 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, but we still have an extra 1. Need to use all four numbers.\n\nTry: (8 \u2212 1 \u2212 1) \u00d7 4",
