In benchmark tasks, common goals include computing the sum, product, mean, etc. Since the numbers suggest a possible geometric pattern (2, 4, 8 are powers of 2), and there's a repeated 4, perhaps the task is to compute the product (2\u00d74\u00d74\u00d78 = 256) or verify if it's a geometric sequence (ratio 2, but repeated 4 breaks strict geometric progression).

Alternatively, the sum is 18, mean is 4.5, median is 4, mode is 4. Since the task is ambiguous, but the product yields a notable number (256 = 2\u2078), and the input contains only powers of 2 (with multiplicity), the most likely intended task is to compute the product.
