    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [1, 1, 2, 7], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., compute a value, find a pattern, solve an equation), I need to infer the likely intent. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve computing something like sum, product, or applying operations in sequence. Given the numbers [1, 1, 2, 7], possible interpretations:\n\n- Could be a sequence: 1, 1, 2, 7 \u2014 differences: 0, 1, 5 \u2014 not obvious.\n- Could be operations: maybe 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 = 11, or 1 * 1 * 2 * 7 = 14.\n- Could be something like factorial or recurrence: 1,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [1, 1, 2, 7], and the only tool is `calc`. Since no explicit goal is given, I need to infer the task. Common benchmark tasks with such inputs involve computing a mathematical expression using the numbers in order, possibly with operations like +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, or parentheses. The sequence 1, 1, 2, 7 resembles a recurrence: 1, 1, then 1+1=2, then 1+2\u00d73=7? Not obvious. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the result of evaluating an expression formed by inserting operators between the numbers. A classic puzzle is to make 24, but 1,1,2,7 can't reach 24 easily. Another idea: perhaps it's the result of a nested expression like ((1 op1 1) op2 2) op3",

Since no explicit goal is stated, I should consider common benchmark tasks involving such number lists \u2014 often evaluating expressions formed by inserting arithmetic operators between numbers, or computing a specific function like sum, product, or a recurrence.
