    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [1, 1, 5, 5]. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the four numbers (each exactly once) and basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to make 24. Let's explore possible combinations.\n\nWe have two 1s and two 5s.\n\nTry: (5 + 5) \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 10 \u00d7 2 = 20 \u2192 too low.\n\nTry: 5 \u00d7 5 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 = 25 \u2212 2 = 23 \u2192 close.\n\nTry: 5 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 1/5)? Wait, we only have two 1s, not a 1/5 unless we make it: 1 \u00f7 5 = 0.2, but we have two 1s and",

Known trick: 5 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 1/5) = 5 \u00d7 (24/5) = 24 \u2014 but that uses three 5s and one 1. We only have two 5s and two 1s.\n\nAlternative: Try (5 + 1) \u00d7 (5 \u2212 1) = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24! Yes! That uses both 5s and both 1s exactly once: (5 + 1) \u00d7 (5 \u2212 1) = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24.\n\nSo the expression is valid. No calculation tool needed yet \u2014 but to confirm, we can compute step-by-step.\n\nACTION: calc (5 + 1) * (5 - 1)",
