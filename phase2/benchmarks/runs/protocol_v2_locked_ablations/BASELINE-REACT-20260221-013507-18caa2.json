Common benchmark tasks with such inputs might involve computing the sum, product, mean, or checking for some property (e.g., are all numbers odd?).\n\nLet\u2019s consider possibilities:\n- Sum: 1 + 3 + 7 + 9 = 20\n- Product: 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 9 = 189\n- Mean: 20 / 4 = 5\n- All odd? Yes \u2014 all numbers are odd.\n\nBut without explicit instructions, the most standard interpretation for a list in a benchmark is often to compute the sum. Since `calc` is available, I can use it to compute the sum.\n\nLet me",
