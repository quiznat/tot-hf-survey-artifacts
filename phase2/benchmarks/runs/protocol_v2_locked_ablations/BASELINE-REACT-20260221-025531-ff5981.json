Since no explicit task is given, but the format matches common benchmark puzzles like the 24 Game, I should attempt to determine if these numbers can be combined (using +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to yield 24. Let me systematically test combinations.\n\nTry:  \n- 8 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 1) \u2212 8 = 8 \u00d7 4 \u2212 8 = 32 \u2212 8 = 24 \u2192 works!  \nSo expression: `8 * (5 - 1) - 8` evaluates to 24.\n\nI should verify this with `calc`.  \nACTION: calc 8 * (5 - 1) - 8",
