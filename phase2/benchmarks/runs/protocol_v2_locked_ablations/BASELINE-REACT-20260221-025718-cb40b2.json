    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [2, 2, 8, 8], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the numbers [2, 2, 8, 8] with arithmetic operations to reach 24 (a common benchmark). Let me try to find an expression using these numbers.\n\nPossible approach:  \n- 8 \u00d7 (2 + 2) = 8 \u00d7 4 = 32 \u2192 too high  \n- (8 + 8) \u00d7 (2 \u00f7 2) = 16 \u00d7 1 = 16  \n- 8 \u00d7 2 + 8 \u00d7 2 = 16 + 16 = 32  \n- (8 \u00d7 2) + (8 + 2) = 16",

Alternatively, 8 \u00d7 (8 \u00f7 2 - 2) = 8 \u00d7 (4 - 2) = 8 \u00d7 2 = 16. Not enough. Try (8 + 8 + 8) = 24, but we only have two 8s. Wait \u2014 what about (8 \u00d7 2) + (8 + 2) = 16 + 10 = 26. Close. How about (8 \u00d7 (2 + 2)) - 8 = 32 - 8 = 24! Yes! That uses both 8s and both 2s: 8 \u00d7 (2 + 2) - 8 = 24. Let me verify: 2 +",
