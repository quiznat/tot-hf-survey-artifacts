    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [1, 1, 5, 5], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, the most likely interpretation is to compute some expression using these numbers \u2014 perhaps to reach 24 (a common 24-game variant), or to compute a sum, product, etc. Let\u2019s consider possible interpretations.\n\nGiven [1, 1, 5, 5], common operations:\n- Sum: 1 + 1 + 5 + 5 = 12\n- Product: 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 = 25\n- (5 \u2212 1) \u00d7 (5 + 1) = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 \u2192 but that uses only three numbers?

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [1, 1, 5, 5], and the only tool is `calc`. Since no specific target or operation is given, the most plausible interpretation is the classic 24 Game: use all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. Let\u2019s test combinations:\n\n- (5 \u2212 1) \u00d7 (5 + 1) = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 \u2192 uses 5, 1, 5, 1 \u2014 all four numbers! Yes, that works.\n\nSo the expression is (5 - 1) * (5 + 1).
