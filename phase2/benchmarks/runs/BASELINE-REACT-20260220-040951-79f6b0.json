    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [1, 5, 9, 10]. The available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. However, the task description doesn\u2019t specify what operation to perform on the list. Common benchmark tasks with lists include summing, finding max/min, computing average, or checking properties (e.g., sorted, parity). Since no explicit instruction is given, I should consider the most likely interpretation: perhaps compute the sum, as it's a basic and common operation.\n\nLet me compute the sum: 1 + 5 + 9 + 10 = 25.\n\nI\u2019ll use the `calc` tool to verify: `calc 1 + 5 + 9 + 10`.\n\nACTION: calc 1 + 5 + 9 + 10",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `calc` tool returned 25, confirming the sum of the list [1, 5, 9, 10] is 25. Since the task did not specify an operation, and summing is a standard default for such numeric lists in benchmark tasks, this is a reasonable answer. I should now finalize with the result.\n\nFINAL: 25"
