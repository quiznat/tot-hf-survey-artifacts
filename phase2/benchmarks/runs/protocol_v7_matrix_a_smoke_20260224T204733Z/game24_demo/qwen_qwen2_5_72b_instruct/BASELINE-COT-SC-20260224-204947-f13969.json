Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify possible operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. **Explore combinations**:\n   - Start with multiplication and division because they can quickly increase or decrease values.\n   - Consider using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n- \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\)\n  - Subtract 7: \\(60 - 7 = 53\\)\n  - Add 1: \\(53 + 1 = 54\\) (not 24)\n\n- \\(10 \\times 7 = 70\\)\n  - Subtract 6: \\(70 - 6 = 64\\)\n  - Add 1: \\(64 + 1 = 65\\) (not 24)\n\n- \\(10 \\times 1 = 10\\)\n  - Add 7: \\(10 + 7 = 17\\)\n  - Multiply by 6: \\(17 \\times 6 = 102\\) (not 24)\n\n- \\(10 + 7 = 17\\)\n  - Multiply by 6: \\(17 \\times 6 = 102\\)\n  - Subtract 1: \\(102 - 1 = 101\\) (not 24)\n\n- \\(10 - 7 = 3\\)\n  - Multiply by 6: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n  - Add 1: \\(18 + 1 = 19\\) (not 24)\n\n- \\(10 - 6 = 4\\)\n  - Multiply by 7: \\(4 \\times 7 = 28\\)\n  - Subtract 1: \\(28 - 1 = 27\\) (not 24)\n\n- \\(10 - 1 = 9\\)\n  - Multiply by 6: \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\)\n  - Subtract 7: \\(54 - 7 = 47\\) (not 24)\n\n- \\(10 + 6 = 16\\)\n  - Multiply by 7",
