    "SAMPLE 2 OUTPUT: To solve this, let's consider the numbers and operations that can lead to 24. We need to use each of 4, 10, 1, and 1 exactly once.\n\n1. Start by considering the number 10. It's a large number, so it might be useful to multiply it by something to get close to 24.\n2. Multiplying 10 by 2.4 would give us 24, but we don't have a 2.4. However, we can get 2.4 by dividing 4 by 1.67, but that's not possible with the given numbers.\n3. Another approach is to use addition and subtraction. If we can get 14 and add 10, we would have 24.\n4. We can get 14 by using 4 and 1. Specifically, 4 * (1 + 1) + 10 = 4 * 2 + 10 = 8 + 10 = 18. This is close but not 24.\n5. Instead, let's try a different approach: 10 + 4 * (1 + 1) = 10 + 4 * 2 = 10 + 8 = 18. Again, not 24.\n6. Let's try using division: 10 * (4 / (1 + 1)) = 10 * (4 / 2) = 10 * 2 = 20. Still not 24.\n7. Finally, let's try a combination of addition and multiplication: 10 + 4 * (1 + 1) = 10 + 4 * 2 = 10 + 8 = 18. This is close, but we need to add 6 more.\n8. We can use the remaining 1 to adjust: 10 + 4 * (1 + 1) + 1 = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19. Still not 24.\n9. Let's try another approach: 10 * (4 - 1) + 1 = 10 * 3 + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31. Too high.\n10.

    "SAMPLE 3 OUTPUT: To achieve 24 using the numbers [4, 10, 1, 1] exactly once, let's explore different combinations and operations:\n\n1. Start by considering the multiplication of 4 and 10:\n   - \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\)\n   - We need to reduce this to 24 using the remaining 1s. \n\n2.

Let's try a factorial or another operation:\n\n7. Use factorial:\n   - \\(4! = 24\\)\n   - We can use the 1s to make up the difference:\n   - \\(4! + 1 - 1 = 24\\)\n\nHowever, since we need to use all numbers exactly once, let's re-evaluate:\n\n8.

Start by considering the largest number, 10, and see if we can use it in a way that helps us get closer to 24.\n2. Since we have two 1s, they can be used to either add or multiply without changing the value much, or they can be combined in a division or subtraction to create a useful intermediate result.\n3. The number 4 can be used in multiplication or addition to help reach 24.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n- \\(10 \\times 4 = 40\\) is too large.\n- \\(10 + 4 = 14\\) is too small.\n- \\(10 - 4 = 6\\) is too small.\n- \\(10 / 4 = 2.5\\) is not useful here.\n\nNow, let's try using the 1s:\n\n- \\(10 + 1 + 1 = 12\\), then \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\), but we don't have another 2.\n- \\(10 - 1 - 1 = 8\\), then \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\), but we don't have another 3.\n- \\(10 \\times (1 + 1) = 20\\), then \\(20 + 4 = 24\\).\n\nThis works! Let's verify:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times (1 + 1) + 4 = 10 \\times 2 + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24 \\]\n\nSo, the final expression is:\n\nFINAL: \\(10 \\times (1 + 1) + 4\\)",
