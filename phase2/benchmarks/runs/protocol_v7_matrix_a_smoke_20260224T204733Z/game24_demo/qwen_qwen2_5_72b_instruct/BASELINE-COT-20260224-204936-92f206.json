    "OUTPUT: To achieve 24 using the numbers [4, 10, 1, 1] exactly once, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by considering the operations that can help us reach 24, such as multiplication and addition.\n2. Notice that multiplying 4 by 6 gives 24, so we need to find a way to get 6 using the other numbers.\n3. We can use the two 1s to create a fraction that, when combined with 10, gives us 6. Specifically, \\(10 - \\frac{1}{1} = 9\\).\n4. However, we need 6, not 9. Instead, we can use the 1s to create a different fraction: \\(10 - 1 + 1 = 10\\), but this doesn't help. Let's try another approach.\n5. Consider the possibility of using division: \\(10 \\div (1 + 1) = 5\\).\n6. Now, we can multiply 4 by 6 to get 24: \\(4 \\times (10 \\div (1 + 1)) = 4 \\times 5 = 20\\). This is close but not quite there.\n7. Let's try another combination: \\(4 \\times (10 - 1 - 1) = 4 \\times 8 = 32\\). This is too high.\n8. Finally, let's try: \\(4 \\times (10 - 1) + 1 = 4 \\times 9 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37\\). This is also incorrect.\n\nAfter re-evaluating, the correct approach is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times (10 - 1 + 1) = 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\]\n\nThis is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the operations and combinations more carefully:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times (10 - (1 + 1)) = 4 \\times (10 - 2) = 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\]\n\nThis is also incorrect. Let's try another approach:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times (10 - 1) + 1 = 4 \\times 9 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37 \\]\n\nFinally, the correct approach is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times (",
