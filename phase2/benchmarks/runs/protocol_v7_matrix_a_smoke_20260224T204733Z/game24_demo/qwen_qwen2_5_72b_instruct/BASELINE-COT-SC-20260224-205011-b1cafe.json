    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use each of the numbers [2, 10, 10, 3] exactly once to produce 24. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify possible operations**: We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. **Consider combinations**:\n   - Multiplication and division can quickly change the scale of the result, so they are good candidates for reaching 24.\n   - Addition and subtraction can be used to adjust the result to 24.\n\n3. **Experiment with different orders and operations**:\n   - Start with the largest numbers to see if they can be combined to get close to 24.\n   - Use smaller numbers to fine-tune the result.\n\n4. **Try specific combinations**:\n   - \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\)\n   - \\(10 + 3 = 13\\)\n   - \\(20 + 13 = 33\\) (too large, try another approach)\n   - \\(10 + 10 = 20\\)\n   - \\(20 + 3 = 23\\)\n   - \\(23 + 2 = 25\\) (too large, try another approach)\n   - \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\)\n   - \\(10 - 3 = 7\\)\n   - \\(20 + 7 = 27\\) (too large, try another approach)\n   - \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)\n   - \\(30 - 10 = 20\\)\n   - \\(20 + 2 = 22\\) (too small, try another approach)\n   - \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\)\n   - \\(20 + 10 = 30\\)\n   - \\(30 - 3 = 27\\) (too large, try another approach)\n   - \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)\n   - \\(30 - 10 = 20\\)\n   - \\(20 + 2 = 22\\) (too small, try another approach)\n   - \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\)\n   - \\(20 + 3 = 23\\)\n   - \\(23 + 1 = 24\\)",
