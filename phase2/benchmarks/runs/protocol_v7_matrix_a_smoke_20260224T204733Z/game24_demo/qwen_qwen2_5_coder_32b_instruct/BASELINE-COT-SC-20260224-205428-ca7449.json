    "SAMPLE 2 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use the given numbers [1, 6, 2, 7] exactly once with any combination of basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to produce the result 24.\n\nFirst, let's consider the target number, 24. We know that 24 can be broken down into factors such as 8 * 3, 12 * 2, etc. Given our numbers, it seems like using multiplication could be effective.\n\nLooking at the numbers, we see that 6 and 4 would make 24 if multiplied (6 * 4 = 24). However, we do not have a 4, but we have a 2 which can be doubled to make 4. This gives us a clue to potentially use the number 2 to modify another number to get 4.\n\nOne approach is to try to reach 4 using 2 and then multiply by 6:\n- We can double 2 to get 4: 2 + 2 (but we only have one 2)\n- Another way to get 4 from 2 is to use division or subtraction, but those don't seem to fit easily with the other numbers.\n\nAnother approach is to manipulate the numbers to get close to 24 or to factor components that can be multiplied to reach 24:\n- If we look at 7 - 1, we get 6, which is already one of our numbers.\n- This leaves us with 6, 6, 2.\n- Now, we need to use these numbers to make 24. One way is to add and then multiply: (6 + 6) * 2 = 12 * 2 = 24.\n\nThus, the expression (7 - 1) * 6 / 2 does not work, but (7 - 1) * 6 / 2 * 2 simplifies incorrectly. The correct approach without extra multiplication is:\n(7 - 1) * (6 / 2) = 6 * 3 = 18 (incorrect)\nBut (7 - 1) * (2 + 2) = 6 * 4 = 24 is incorrect due to repeating 2.\nHowever, (7 - 1) * 6 / 2 * 2 works if we correctly use all numbers once:\n(7 - 1) * 6 / 2 *",

We have 6 and need to form 4 using 1, 2, and 7.\n3. Notice that (2 * 7 - 10 = 14) doesn't work for forming 4, but (7 - 2 - 1 = 4) does work.\n4.

    "SAMPLE 5 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, I'll try to use the given numbers in different arithmetic combinations to see if I can reach 24. \n\nFirst, let's see if we can multiply any two numbers and then use the other two to reach 24:\n- 6 * 4 = 24, but we don't have a 4, so this doesn't work directly.\n- 7 * 3 = 21, close but not 24.\n- 1 * 24 = 24, but we can't form 24 from the other numbers.\n- 2 * 12 = 24, but we can't form 12 from the other numbers.\n- 6 * 2 = 12, and then we need to use 1 and 7 to get to 24.

Consider the operations available: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n2. We start by looking for ways to multiply or divide the numbers to get closer to 24.\n3. Notice that 6 * 4 = 24, so we need to find a way to make 4 using the remaining numbers (1, 2, and 7).\n4. One approach is to see if we can manipulate 7 and 2 to get close to 4, and then use 1 appropriately.\n5. We can try 7 - 2 = 5, which is not useful as it does not help us reach 4 directly.\n6. Another approach is to consider division of 7 by something to make 4, but since 7 / x should be close to 4, no simple integer solution comes up.\n7. Instead, let's try using 2 * 2 = 4, which means we need to make another 2 from 7 and 1.\n8. We can achieve this by calculating 7 - 1 - 4, but that doesn't work because we need to use all numbers.\n9. However, we can try (7 - 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3, and then 6 * 4 = 6 * (2 * 2) doesn't work either directly.\n10. Another useful equation is 7 + 1 = 8, and 8 - 2 = 6, but we already have a 6.\n11.

First, it's important to note that the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) will be crucial to solving this puzzle.\n2. We can start by looking for combinations that might get us close to 24, or directly to it.\n3. One useful strategy is to try to create a multiplication factor that, when combined with another number, will give us 24.\n\nLet's explore some possibilities:\n\n- Multiplying 6 and 4 gives 24, but we don't have a 4. However, we can see if we can manipulate the other numbers to get a 4.\n- Another approach is to multiply 7 and 3 to get 21, and then add 3 more to reach 24. But again, we need to see if we can form a 3 and an additional 3 from the given numbers.\n- Let's try another approach: multiplying 6 and 7 is much too large, so we'll need to divide or subtract something first.\n\nA potential solution could involve using 7 - 1 = 6, and then working with the remaining 6 and 2.\n\n- We can try (7 - 1) * 6, which equals 6 * 6 = 36.

We need to adjust the approach slightly.\n\nAnother idea is to try manipulating the numbers differently:\n- We know 6 * 4 = 24, so let's see if we can use the other two numbers to modify the 6 or the 4.\n- We can try (7 + 1) / 2 * 6 to see if this works.\n\nLet's test this:\n- (7 + 1) / 2 * 6\n- 8 / 2 * 6\n- 4 * 6\n- 24",

Here's my step-by-step thinking:\n\n1. First, I notice that 6 is a factor of 24, so it makes sense to use multiplication involving 6.\n2. Trying to multiply 6 by 2 gives 12, which is still far from 24. So, I'll explore further with these two numbers.\n3. If I subtract 1 from 7, I get 6, but I already have a 6, so this doesn't help directly.\n4. Instead, I can consider 6 * (2 + 1), which equals 6 * 3 = 18. This is closer to 24.\n5. Now, I need to add 6 more to reach 24. The remaining number is 7, and adding 7 to 18 gives 25, which is too high.\n6. However, if I reconsider the expression and try 6 * (7 - 1), I get 6 * 6 = 36, which is too high.\n7. Another approach could be (7 - 1) * (6 + 2), which simplifies to 6 * 8 = 48, also too high.\n8. But if I try (7 - 1) * (6 / 2), I get 6 * 3 = 18, again too low but I haven't used addition yet.\n9. Finally, if I adjust the last part to (7 - 1) * (6 - 2) + 1 * 2, I get 6 * 4 + 2 = 24 + 2, which is incorrect.\n10. Correcting the approach, (7 - 1) * (6 / 2) + 2 * 1 gives 6 * 3 + 2 = 18 + 6, which is incorrect.\n11. The correct way should be (7 - 1) * (6 / 2) + 2 which gives 6 * 3 + 2 = 18 + 6, still incorrect but close.\n12. Revisiting, (7 - 1) * (6 / 2) + 6 - 2 gives 6 * 3 + 4",

    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, I need to use the numbers 1, 6, 2, and 7 exactly once to form an expression that equals 24. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll consider if any of the numbers can be directly used as part of the multiplication or division to get close to 24.\n2. The number 6 is a good starting point because it can be multiplied by 4 to give 24. However, we don't have a 4, but we can try to make 4 using the other numbers.\n3. Looking at the remaining numbers - 1, 2, and 7 - we see that 2 * (7 - 1) = 2 * 6 = 12, which is half of 24. This suggests we might be able to double 12 to get 24.\n4. Indeed, if we multiply 12 by 2, we get 24. Now we just need to fit the number 6 into this expression without changing its value.\n5. We can achieve this by dividing 6 by 1 (which doesn't change the value) and then multiplying by 2 * (7 - 1).\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n6 / 1 * 2 * (7 - 1)\n\nCalculating step by step:\n- 7 - 1 = 6\n- 2 * 6 = 12\n- 6 / 1 = 6\n- 6 * 12 = 24\n\nThis expression uses all four numbers exactly once and equals 24.\n\nFINAL: 6 / 1 * 2 * (7 - 1)",

    "VOTE SUMMARY: 6 * (7 - 1 - 2) -> 1, (7 - 1) * (2 + 2) -> 1, To solve this problem, I'll try different combinations of operations and numbers to see which one gives us 24.\n\nFirst, let's consider multiplication and addition, as these are often useful in reaching 24.\n- Multiplying 6 by 4 would give us 24, but we don't have a 4 directly; we could potentially create it by manipulating other numbers.\n\nConsidering the numbers 1, 2, 6, and 7:\n- If we multiply 6 by 2, we get 12. We need to reach 24 from here.\n- We can subtract 1 from 7 to get 6, then add that to 12, giving us 18. This is close but not enough.\n- Another approach is to use division to create a fraction or a smaller number that could be useful in combination with others.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n- We can multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. We need to figure out how to incorporate 6 and 1 to reach 24.\n- If we add 6 to 14, we get 20. We still need to reach 24.\n- Now, consider using 1 in a way that could help us get the extra 4 we need.\n- Dividing 6 by 1 doesn't change 6, so we need another operation.\n- Subtracting 1 from 6 gives us 5, which isn't useful here.\n- Adding 1 to 6 gives us 7, which we already used in multiplication.\n\nAnother angle:\n- Subtracting 1 from 2 gives us 1, which doesn't bring us closer to a solution.\n- Dividing 2 by 1 gives us 2.\n- Let's consider using subtraction in a different way with the larger numbers.\n- Subtracting 2 from 7 gives us 5, which again doesn't seem promising.\n- Subtracting 1 from 7 gives us 6, which we already have.\n\nExploring a different path:\n- Let's try to manipulate the numbers to create a useful intermediate result.\n- Multiplying 7 by 2 is 14.\n- We need to add 10 more to reach 24.\n- Let's see if we can create 10 using 6 and 1.\n- Adding 6 and 1 gives us 7, which isn't 10.\n- Subtracting 1 from 6 -> 1, (6 * 4 -> 1, - 7 + 1 -> 1, (7 - 1) / 2 -> 1, 6 * 4 -> 1, (7 - 1) * (6 - 2) + 1 * 2 -> 1, ( (7 - 1) -> 1, - 6 * 12 -> 1",
