    "OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 10, 1, and 1 exactly once to form an expression that equals 24. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We start with the numbers: 4, 10, 1, 1.\n2. We need to find a way to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to get 24.\n3. One approach is to try to manipulate the numbers to get close to 24 and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try the following steps:\n\n- First, consider multiplying 4 and 10, which gives us 40.\n- Now, we need to reduce 40 by 16 to get 24.\n- We can achieve this reduction by subtracting (1 + 1) * 8 from 40, but since we don't have an 8, we need to find another way.\n- Instead, let's try subtracting 10 from 40 first, which gives us 30.\n- Now, we need to reduce 30 by 6 to get 24.\n- We can achieve this reduction by subtracting (1 + 1) * 3 from 30, but since we don't have a 3, we need to find another way.\n- Let's try another combination: (10 - 4) * (1 + 1) = 6 * 2 = 12, which is not enough.\n- Let's try: (10 - 1) * (4 - 1) = 9 * 3 = 27, which is too much.\n- Let's try: (10 - 1) - (4 - 1) = 9 - 3 = 6, which is not enough.\n- Let's try: (10 - 4) / (1 - 1), but this is undefined.\n- Let's try: (10 - 4) * 1 + 1 * 16, but we don't have a 16.\n- Let's try: (10 - 4) * (1 + 1) + 1 * 4 = 6 * 2 + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16, which is not enough.\n- Let's try:",
