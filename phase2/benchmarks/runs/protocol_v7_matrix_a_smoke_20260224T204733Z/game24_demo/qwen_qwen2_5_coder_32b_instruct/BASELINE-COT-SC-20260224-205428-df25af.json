First, consider the operations that might help us reach 24: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n2. We should look at combining numbers in ways that get us close to 24.\n3. One effective strategy is to try to create a fraction or a decimal that can be manipulated to reach 24 when combined with another number through multiplication or addition.\n4. Let's start with trying to use division to create a useful intermediate result. Notice that 10 divided by 7 is approximately 1.42857, which isn't very useful on its own, but it might be if we could multiply it by something to get close to 24.\n5. Instead of focusing on division first, let's try multiplication. Multiplying 6 and 10 gives us 60, which is too large, but subtracting 7 from 60 gives us 53, and subtracting 1 from 53 doesn't help. So, we need to find a way to reduce 60.\n6. Another possibility is to use 6 and 7 in a way that gets us closer to 24. Multiplying 6 and 7 gives us 42, which is close to 24.

    "SAMPLE 3 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, I will try to manipulate the numbers [1, 10, 7, 6] using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to achieve the result of 24. Here\u2019s my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, I'll consider the largest number, 10, and see if it can be used in a way that simplifies the problem. Multiplying 10 by any other number larger than 2 would exceed 24, so multiplication with 10 isn't immediately useful unless we divide by something first.\n\n2. Next, I'll try to use the smaller numbers to reach a useful intermediate step. I notice that 7 x 6 = 42, which is too large, but subtracting a value from this might help. \n\n3. If we subtract 18 from 42, we get 24. We can obtain 18 by multiplying 6 by 3, but since we don't have a 3, we need another way.\n\n4. Considering the number 1, we can multiply 6 by 3 (which we don\u2019t have directly), but we can add 1 to make 7 and then subtract 7 from 10 to get 3. This gives us an idea to use subtraction to get 3 as an intermediate step.\n\n5. So, let's try to incorporate the subtraction in our expression. We can calculate 10 - 7 = 3. Then we can use the 6 and multiply it by this result to get 18, and finally add the remaining 1 to make 19, but we need to adjust this to reach 24.\n\n6. Instead of adding 1 after multiplication, we can try to manipulate the equation further. We already have 6 x (10 - 7) = 18. Now, if we can find a way to incorporate the remaining 1 and 6 to reach 24, we would be successful.\n\n7. After reviewing the numbers again, a plausible approach is to consider manipulating the 6 in conjunction with the 1. If we divide 6 by 1, we still have 6, but this doesn't help much. However, if we look for another combination, we can try (10 - 7 + 1) * 6. Simplifying inside the parentheses first gives us (4) * 6 = 2",

    "SAMPLE 4 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 10, 7, and 6 exactly once to make 24. Let's think through potential operations and combinations:\n\nFirst, consider multiplication and division as they can yield larger or smaller numbers more quickly.\n\nMultiplying 7 and 6 gives us 42, which is too large to work with directly to get 24 after adding or subtracting the remaining numbers (1 and 10).\n\nNext, let's try multiplying 10 and 6, which gives us 60. This is also too large, but we can subtract 36 (which is 6*6) to get a smaller number, and then add or subtract the other numbers. However, using 6 twice would violate the rule of using each number exactly once, so this approach won't work.\n\nNow, let's try multiplying 10 and 7, yielding 70. This is much too large, even when considering subtraction.\n\nGiven that direct multiplication results in numbers too large, let's explore addition and subtraction first, possibly combining them with multiplication.\n\nConsider 10 + 7 = 17. We need to get from 17 to 24 using 1 and 6. Multiplying 17 by 6 is too large, and adding either 1 or 6 doesn't help.\n\nTry 10 - 7 = 3. Now we need to get from 3 to 24 using 1 and 6. Multiplying 3 by 6 gives us 18, and adding 6 again would be too much. But adding 6 first and then multiplying by 2 (which we don't have) wouldn't work. Instead, we can multiply 3 by 8, but we don't have an 8 directly. However, if we add 1 to 7 first, we get 8, then multiply by 3, we get 24, but we've used 7 twice, which is not allowed.\n\nLet's try another combination, 7 - 1 = 6.

Alternatively, I could try subtraction or division to bring down the result from 60.\n\nI can see that 60 - 36 = 24, so I need to form 36 using 7 and 1.

Their product is 42, which is also too large.\n4. Now, I try to incorporate 1 into the equation since it doesn't change the result of multiplication or division.\n5. Subtracting 7 from 10 gives 3, which when multiplied by 8 would give 24. However, we don't have an 8, but we can get close by using 6 and 1 to adjust.\n6. One way is to multiply 7 by 3 (which isn't directly available), but we can get 3 by using 10 - 7.\n7. Then, we need to get 8 from 6 and 1. Adding 6 and 2 would give 8, but 2 isn\u2019t directly available. However, adding 6 and (10 - 7) - 1 = 6 + 2 = 8 works.\n8. Finally, (10 - 7) * (6 + 1) = 3 * 7 = 21 doesn\u2019t work, but we notice another combination: (10 - 7) * (6 / 1 + 6 - 6) = 3 * 6 = 18 doesn't work either, so let's try a different approach.\n9. Another thought is to use 6 and 1 to make a smaller number that, when combined with 7 and 10, can yield 24. Consider (10 - 7 + 1) * 6 = 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nThis combination seems to work perfectly. Let\u2019s verify it:\n- 10 - 7 = 3\n- 3 + 1 = 4\n- 4 * 6 = 24\n\nThus, the expression using all numbers exactly once to produce",

    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use each of the numbers 1, 10, 7, and 6 exactly once to create an expression that equals 24. Let's explore different operations:\n\nFirst, consider multiplication and addition:\n- Multiplying 10 by 2 would give 20, but we don't have a 2, so let's see if we can make a 2 using other numbers.\n- Multiplying 7 by 3 would give 21, which is close to 24, but again, we don't have a 3.\n\nNext, let's try using subtraction and division:\n- Dividing 10 by something smaller than itself might be useful. Dividing 10 by 1 is just 10, which is not helpful.\n- Dividing 10 by 2.5 (which isn't an integer and thus not possible with our set) or other non-integers also won't work.\n\nNow, let's mix some operations:\n- Consider 10 - 6 = 4\n- Then, we need to multiply 4 by something to get 24. The only remaining number is 7, and 4 * 7 = 28, which is too high.\n- Instead, let's try 10 - 4 = 6. But we've already used 6, so this won't work either.\n- We could try 7 - 1 = 6, then we have 6, 6, and 10. But we still need to use all numbers, and 6*6=36, which is too high.\n- Another mix: (10 - 1) = 9, then 9 * 7 / 6 = 63 / 6 = 10.5, which isn't 24.\n- Let's try 10 - 7 = 3, then 3 * 6 = 18, and we need to add 1 more to reach 24. This won't work as we can't add 1 to the product directly.\n\nAfter trying various combinations, one approach works:\n- First, subtract 7 from 10 to get 3.\n- Then multiply 3 by 6 to get 18.\n- Finally, add 6 to 18, but since 6 is already used, add 1 * 6 instead, which still gives",

Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, consider the operations that might help us reach 24: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n2. We should look at combining numbers in ways that get us close to 24.\n3. One effective strategy is to try to create a fraction or a decimal that can be manipulated to reach 24 when combined with another number through multiplication or addition.\n4. Let's start with trying to use division to create a useful intermediate result. Notice that 10 divided by 7 is approximately 1.42857, which isn't very useful on its own, but it might be if we could multiply it by something to get close to 24.\n5. Instead of focusing on division first, let's try multiplication. Multiplying 6 and 10 gives us 60, which is too large, but subtracting 7 from 60 gives us 53, and subtracting 1 from 53 doesn't help. So, we need to find a way to reduce 60.\n6. Another possibility is to use 6 and 7 in a way that gets us closer to 24. Multiplying 6 and 7 gives us 42, which is close to 24. If we could add 10 and then subtract 18, we would reach 24. However, we don't have 18 in our set of numbers.\n7. Let's try using subtraction and then multiplication. Subtracting 1 from 10 gives us 9. Multiplying 9 by 7 gives us 63, which is too large. Subtracting 6 from 63 gives us 57, and subtracting 1 from 57 doesn't help. So, we need to find another way.\n8. Another strategy is to try to create a useful intermediate result through addition and then manipulate it further. Adding 10 and 7 gives us 17. Multiplying 17 by 6 gives us 102, which is too large. Subtracting 1 from 102 doesn't help. So, we need to find another way.\n9. Let's try using division and then addition. -> 1, - (10 - 7) * 6 -> 1, 4 * 6 -> 1, - 4 * 6 -> 1",
