    "SAMPLE 1 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 3, 4, 4, and 8 exactly once to create an expression that equals 24. Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1) First, consider the multiplication of 4 and 8, which gives us 32. This is too large, but it might be useful if we can subtract something from it.\n2) Next, think about how we can use the smaller numbers (3 and 4) to reach or adjust to 24. If we subtract 8 from 32, we get 24, which is our target. So, we need to find a way to use the two 4s and the 3 to make 8.\n3) We can achieve 8 by adding 4 to the result of 4 divided by 3, but since we can't use fractional results directly, let's try another combination.\n4) A more feasible approach is to multiply 3 by 8 and then adjust using the two 4s. However, 3 * 8 = 24 already meets our target, so we need to incorporate both 4s.\n5) Instead, let's try dividing 8 by the result of 4 divided by 3, which would be (8 / (4/3)). This simplifies to (8 * 3 / 4) = 6. Multiplying this by the remaining 4 gives us 24.\n\nTherefore, the expression that uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 24 is:\n\nFINAL: (8 / (4/3)) * 4",

    "SAMPLE 2 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use the given numbers [3, 4, 4, 8] exactly once to form an equation that equals 24. Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we should consider the operations that can be used: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n2. We know that multiplication can quickly increase the value, so it might be useful to use it with larger numbers.\n3. One effective strategy is to try combining numbers to get a result close to 24 and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n4. Let's start by trying to multiply 8 and 3, which gives us 24. However, we still have two 4s left, and we must use them.\n5. Since multiplying or dividing by 4 with 24 would not help (either giving us 96 or 6, respectively), we need to see if we can manipulate the 4s to get a different intermediate result.\n6. Another idea is to see if we can combine the 4s in some way to create a multiplier or divisor that helps us reach 24 when used with 8.\n7. If we add the two 4s together, we get 8. Multiplying 8 (from the sum of 4s) by 3 gives us 24, but we still have an extra 8 left.\n8. Instead of adding the 4s, let's try subtracting 4 from 8, which gives us 4. Now, we have three 4s and one 3.\n9. We can then multiply these three 4s together, resulting in 64. Dividing 64 by 4 gives us 16, and multiplying 16 by 3 gives us 48, which is too high.\n10. A different approach involves using the 4s in a division to reduce the impact of the large number 8.\n11. If we divide 8 by 4, we get 2. Now, we have 2, 4, and 3 left.\n12. Multiplying 2 by 4 gives us 8, and then multiplying that by 3 results in 24.\n\nThus, the expression that uses each number exactly once to produce 24 is:\nFINAL: (8 / 4) * 4 * 3",

Let's approach this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We should aim to use multiplication because it can quickly increase the value of our expression, which is necessary to reach 24.\n\nLet's start by trying to multiply two of the numbers:\n- \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)\n- \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\)\n- \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n- \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\) (This looks promising)\n\nSince \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\), we've reached our goal directly using two of the numbers. Now we need to incorporate the remaining two 4s into the expression without changing the result. One way to do this is to multiply and divide by 4, which will cancel out and not affect the result.\n\nThus, we can write the expression as:\n\\[8 \\times 3 \\times \\frac{4}{4}\\]\n\nThis expression uses all four numbers exactly once and simplifies to 24.\n\nFINAL: 8 * 3 * (4 / 4)",

    "SAMPLE 4 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, I need to use the numbers [3, 4, 4, 8] exactly once to create an expression that equals 24. Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. First, consider the multiplication and division operations since they can significantly alter the size of the numbers we're working with.\n2. Notice that 8 is the largest number, and multiplying it by 3 gives 24, which is our target. However, we need to incorporate the two 4s in the expression as well.\n3. One way to use the 4s is to multiply them together to get 16, but that doesn't help us reach 24 when used with 8 or 3.\n4. Another approach could be to divide one of the 4s by 3 or 8, but that would result in a fraction, which complicates reaching an integer solution of 24.\n5. Consider the possibility of using the 4s in subtraction or addition, possibly in conjunction with 8, to create a value that can then be multiplied by 3 to reach 24.\n6. By subtracting 4 from 8, we get 4. If we then add the other 4, we get 8 again, which doesn't help.\n7. However, if we subtract 4 from 8 and then multiply the result by 3, we get 12. We still need to incorporate the last 4.\n8. To reach 24 from 12, we can simply add the remaining 4 to 12 and then multiply by 2, but since we don't have a 2, we need another way.\n9. Instead, let's try adding the remaining 4 to the result before multiplying by 3. So, we add 4 to 8 (which gives us 12) and then subtract 4 to get back to 8, and finally multiply by 3 to get 24.\n10. This doesn't directly work either, so let's try another combination. We can multiply 4 by 4 to get 16, then subtract 8 from 16 to get 8, and finally multiply by 3 to get 24.\n\nThus, the expression (4 * 4 - 8) * 3 uses each number exactly once and equals 24.\n\nFINAL: (4 * 4 - 8) *",

Another useful fact is that 4 + 4 = 8, but this would not be helpful as it would cancel out the original 8 we have.\n7. Instead, let's try dividing 8 by 4, which gives us 2.\n8.
