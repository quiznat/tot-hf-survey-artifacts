    "PROMPT: Use each number exactly once to produce 24. Numbers: [6, 4, 10, 4]. Return only one expression in the final answer.\n\nThink step by step before answering.\nEnd with exactly one line:\nFINAL: <answer>\n",
    "OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 6, 4, 10, and 4 exactly once to form an expression that equals 24. Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n2. We should try to use multiplication and division since they can quickly change the scale of our numbers.\n3. Notice that 6 * 4 = 24, but we still have two more numbers (10 and 4) to use.\n4. We can manipulate the remaining numbers to get a result of 1, which would not affect the product of 6 and 4.\n5. One way to achieve this is by using the expression (10 - 4) / 4, which simplifies to 6 / 4 = 1.5, but we need exactly 1.\n6. Another approach is to use (10 - 4) / 4 * 4, which simplifies to 6 / 4 * 4 = 6, and then multiply by 6 to get 24.\n7. However, a simpler and correct approach is to use (10 - 4) / 4 + 4, which simplifies to 6 / 4 + 4 = 1.5 + 4 = 5.5, but we need to adjust it.\n8. The correct manipulation is to use 6 * ((10 - 4) / 4 + 1), which simplifies to 6 * (6 / 4 + 1) = 6 * (1.5 + 1) = 6 * 2.5 = 15, but we need to adjust it again.\n9. The right expression is 6 * (10 / 4 - 4 / 4), which simplifies to 6 * (2.5 - 1) = 6 * 1.5 = 9, but we need to adjust it.\n10. The correct expression is 6 * (10 - 4) / 4, which simplifies to 6 * 6 / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9, but we need to adjust it.\n11. The correct expression is 6 * (4 / (10 - 4)), which simplifies to 6 *",
