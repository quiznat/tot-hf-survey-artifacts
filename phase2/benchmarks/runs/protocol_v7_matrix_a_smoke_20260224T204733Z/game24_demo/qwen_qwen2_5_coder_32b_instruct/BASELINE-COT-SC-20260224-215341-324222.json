    "SAMPLE 1 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 4, 10, 1, and 1 exactly once to form an expression that equals 24. Here is a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Start by examining if any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can yield 24 directly or through intermediate steps.\n2. Consider the order of operations (parentheses) to group terms and change the sequence of calculations.\n3. Notice that multiplying 10 by 2.4 would give us 24, but since we only have 4 and 1s, we need to find a way to create a factor close to 2.4 using these numbers.\n4. Recognize that 4 divided by (10 minus 4) gives 2/3, which is useful because it can interact with the remaining 1s and 4 to approach our target.\n5. Try to combine the numbers in a way that might lead to the required result. One effective combination is to first calculate 10 minus 4, then take the reciprocal of the result, and multiply by 4. Finally, add the remaining 1 to adjust the result to 24.\n\nLet's construct this step by step:\n\n- Calculate \\(10 - 4 = 6\\).\n- Take the reciprocal of 6, which is \\(1/6\\), and multiply by 4: \\(4 \\times (1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3\\).\n- To get closer to 24, we need to find a way to scale \\(2/3\\) up significantly. Notice that \\(1/(1 - 2/3) = 1/(1/3) = 3\\).\n- Multiply 4 by 3: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n- Now, we need to reach 24 from 12. Adding the remaining 1 twice won't work, so instead, consider scaling 12 up to 24 by multiplying by 2. We can achieve this by recognizing that \\(10 - 4 \\times 1 = 6\\), and then taking the reciprocal of \\(1 - 1/6 = 5/6\\) and multiplying by 12 does not directly help.\n- Instead, let's reconsider the grouping: \\(4 \\div (10 - 4) \\times (1 + 1) = 4 \\",

First, consider the operations that can be used: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n2. We need to manipulate these numbers to reach 24. Since 24 is a relatively small number, it makes sense to look at multiplication as a key operation.\n3. Notice that 4 * 6 = 24, so we need to create the number 6 using the remaining numbers 10, 1, and 1.\n4. We can try to get close to 6 by using subtraction or division. A useful combination might be (10 - 4) / 1 = 6, but we still have an extra 1.\n5. Instead, let's try using the 1s in a way that they cancel out without altering the result. One effective way is to multiply by 1 or divide by 1, which won't change the value.\n6. Consider (10 - 4) * 1 / 1 = 6, then we just need to multiply this result by 4 to get 24.\n7. However, since we must use all numbers including two 1s, we should reconsider the placement of the 1s.\n8. Another possibility is to use the 1s in the denominator or numerator in a way that simplifies to 1. For example, (10 - 4) / (1 / 1) = 6.\n9. Now, we can multiply this result by 4 to get 24.\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n(10 - 4) / (1 / 1) * 4 = 24\n\nHowever, we need to ensure we use all numbers exactly once. The correct placement while using all numbers is:\n(10 - 4) / 1 * (1 + 1) * 4 = 24\n\nBut simplifying this further, we realize:\n(10 - 4) * (1 + 1) * 1 = 6 * 2 * 1 = 12 * 1 = 12 (incorrect)\n\nSo, let's re-evaluate:\n(10 - 4) * (1 + 1) = 6 *",

    "SAMPLE 3 OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use the four numbers 4, 10, 1, and 1 exactly once to create an expression that equals 24. Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with the larger numbers and see if we can manipulate them to reach 24.\n2. Consider using the 10 as part of a multiplication or division since it's large enough to be a significant factor in reaching 24.\n3. We can try 10 - 4 = 6, which is a simple subtraction.\n4. Now we need to use the two 1s to manipulate the result of 6 to get 24.\n5. One way could be to multiply 6 by something that gives us 24. Since we have two 1s, we can use one to add to a fraction involving the other to create a multiplier.\n6. Notice that (1 + 1/1) = 2, and 6 * 2 = 12, which isn't our target.\n7. However, if we consider (1 + 1/4) = 1.25, and try to incorporate the 10 in a different way, we can explore 10 / (1 + 1/4) = 10 / 1.25 = 8.\n8. Then, multiplying 8 by the remaining 3 (which we can get by 4 - 1) would give us 24. But we don't have a 3, so we'll adjust our approach.\n9. Instead, let's directly try to use the two 1s in a way that manipulates the 4 and 10 effectively.\n10. If we do (10 - 4) / (1 - 1/4), we get 6 / (3/4) = 6 * (4/3) = 8.\n11. Now, we need to multiply 8 by 3 to get 24. Since we don't have a 3, but we can make 3 by using the two 1s with the 4: 4 - (1/1) = 3.\n12. However, a simpler manipulation exists: just multiply the 8 by 3 directly, and we notice we already have the 8 from our previous step, so we need to find a way to bring the 3",

First, consider what operations could be used to combine these numbers to reach 24. Since we have a 10, which is relatively close to 24, we might want to use it in a way that it can be increased or decreased to reach 24.\n\n2. We can try to multiply 10 by another number to get close to 24, but since the other numbers are 4, 1, and 1, multiplying by any of them will not help us reach 24 directly.\n\n3. Another approach is to use subtraction or addition in conjunction with multiplication or division. For example, if we subtract 1 from 10, we get 9. But 9 multiplied by 4 is 36, which is too high.\n\n4. We can try subtracting 1 from 10 to get 9, then divide 4 by 1 (which does not change its value), and add 1 to get a closer expression. However, 9 * 4 + 1 = 37, which is still too high.\n\n5. Let's consider using division differently. If we divide 4 by (1 - 1/10), we get a decimal number, but it\u2019s not useful in this context.\n\n6. Another angle to explore is using the numbers in a different combination with the operations. We know that 4 multiplied by 6 equals 24, so let\u2019s think about how we can get 6 from the numbers 10, 1, and 1.\n\n7. We can subtract 4 from 10 to get 6, but we need to incorporate the 1s. If we subtract 1 from 1, we get 0, which won't help us. However, if we add 1 to 1, we get 2, and if we subtract 2 from 10, we get 8, which is not useful either.\n\n8. The key insight here is to use the 1s in a way that they don\u2019t affect the multiplication of 4 and 6.

So, we need to find a way to make the number 6 from the remaining numbers (10, 1, 1).\n3) One approach could be to subtract a smaller number from a larger one to get close to 6.

We can subtract 1 from 9, which gives us 8, or add them, which gives us 10, but neither of these is helpful.\n5) Another approach is to see if we can form fractions or use division effectively. Dividing 10 by 10 gives us 1, which doesn't help. But dividing 10 by 1 and then subtracting 1 gives us 9.\n6) To get from 9 to 6, we can subtract 3. We don't have a 3 directly, but we can subtract 1 + 1 from 9 to get 7, and then subtract 1 more to reach 6.\n7) However, we need to use the numbers exactly once, and subtracting 1+1 and then another 1 uses up all the 1s, leaving us with no way to use the 4.\n8) Let's reconsider the order and grouping of operations.

Now we need to use 1 and 1 to transform 6 into 24.\n  \n  - \\(6 + 1 + 1 = 8\\) (too small)\n  - \\(6 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 6\\) (too small)\n  - \\(6 * (1 + 1) = 6 \\times 2 = 12\\) (still too small)\n\n- Let's try another approach by manipulating the subtraction differently:\n  \n  - \\(10 - 1 = 9\\). Now we need to use 4 and 1 to transform 9 into 24.\n    \n    - \\(9 + 4 + 1 = 14\\) (too small)\n    - \\(9 \\times 4 - 1 = 36 - 1 = 35\\) (too large)\n    - \\(9 \\times (4 - 1) = 9 \\times 3 = 27\\) (close",
