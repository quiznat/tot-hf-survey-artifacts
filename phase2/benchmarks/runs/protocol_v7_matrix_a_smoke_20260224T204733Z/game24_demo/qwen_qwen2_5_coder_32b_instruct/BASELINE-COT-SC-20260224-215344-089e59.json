We have two 4s, which might be useful for making 8 (4 + 4) or as a multiplier.\n3. The number 10 is close to 12, so subtracting 2 from it could be useful (10 - 4 = 6).\n4.

Notice that 6 and 4 multiply to give 24, but we have two 4s and a 10 also, so we need to incorporate all numbers.\n3. One way to use all four numbers is to start with the known product of 6 and 4 and then find a way to involve the other two numbers, 4 and 10.\n4. Since we already have 24 from 6 * 4, we need to create an expression that doesn't alter this result or combines it with the remaining numbers in a way that still equals 24.\n5.

However, this doesn't help since we need whole numbers.\n    - Instead, let's consider if we can subtract a part of 10 from 6*4 in a way that uses the remaining 4 effectively.\n    - Subtracting 10 from 24 (which is 6*4) would leave us with 14. We need to find a way to incorporate the remaining 4 to get to 0, but this seems tricky.\n    - Let's try another approach by breaking down 10 into useful components. Notice that",
