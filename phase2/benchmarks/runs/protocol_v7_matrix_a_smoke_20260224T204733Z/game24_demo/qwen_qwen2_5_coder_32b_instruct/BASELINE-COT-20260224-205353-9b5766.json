    "PROMPT: Use each number exactly once to produce 24. Numbers: [1, 6, 2, 7]. Return only one expression in the final answer.\n\nThink step by step before answering.\nEnd with exactly one line:\nFINAL: <answer>\n",
    "OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 6, 2, and 7 exactly once to form an expression that equals 24. Let's try different combinations of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and parentheses to find a solution.\n\nOne possible approach is to start by multiplying two numbers and then using the other two numbers to reach 24. Let's try multiplying 6 and 4 (which isn't directly available but can be formed by adding 2 and 2, or by other means).\n\nAnother approach is to consider the possibility of using division to simplify the problem. For example, dividing 7 by 1 gives us 7, which might be useful in combination with the other numbers.\n\nLet's try the following steps:\n\n1. Multiply 6 and 2 to get 12.\n2. Add 7 to 12 to get 19.\n3. Subtract 1 from 19 to get 18.\n4. This doesn't work, so let's try another combination.\n\nNow, let's try:\n\n1. Subtract 1 from 7 to get 6.\n2. This doesn't help since we already have a 6, so let's try another operation.\n3. Let's try dividing 7 by 1, which gives us 7.\n4. Now, we need to use 6 and 2 to get to 24 when combined with 7.\n5. Multiplying 6 and 2 gives us 12.\n6. Adding 12 to 7 doesn't give us 24, so let's try another operation.\n7. Let's try subtracting 7 from 12, which gives us 5.\n8. This also doesn't help, so let's try another combination.\n9. Let's try (7 - 1) * 6 / 2 = 6 * 6 / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18.\n10. This doesn't work, so let's try another combination.\n11. Let's try (7 - 1) * (6 / 2) = 6 * 3 = 18.\n12. This also doesn't work, so let's try another combination.\n13. Let's try (7 - 1) * 2 * 6 / 2 = 6 * 2 * 6 / 2 = 12",
