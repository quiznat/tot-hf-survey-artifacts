    "PROMPT: Use each number exactly once to produce 24. Numbers: [1, 10, 7, 6]. Return only one expression in the final answer.\n\nThink step by step before answering.\nEnd with exactly one line:\nFINAL: <answer>\n",
    "OUTPUT: To solve this problem, we need to use the numbers 1, 10, 7, and 6 exactly once to form an expression that equals 24. Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, consider the operations that can be used: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n2. We need to find a combination of these operations that will yield 24 when applied to the numbers 1, 10, 7, and 6.\n3. One effective strategy is to try to get close to 24 using multiplication and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's start by trying to multiply some of the numbers to see if we can get close to 24:\n\n- Multiplying 10 and 6 gives us 60, which is too large.\n- Multiplying 10 and 7 gives us 70, which is also too large.\n- Multiplying 7 and 6 gives us 42, which is too large.\n- Multiplying 10 and 1 gives us 10, which is not enough.\n- Multiplying 7 and 1 gives us 7, which is not enough.\n- Multiplying 6 and 1 gives us 6, which is not enough.\n\nSince direct multiplication doesn't seem to work, let's try combining multiplication with addition or subtraction:\n\n- Consider (10 - 7) * 6 + 1 = 3 * 6 + 1 = 18 + 1 = 19, which is not 24.\n- Consider (10 - 6) * 7 + 1 = 4 * 7 + 1 = 28 + 1 = 29, which is not 24.\n- Consider (10 - 1) * 6 - 7 = 9 * 6 - 7 = 54 - 7 = 47, which is not 24.\n- Consider (10 - 1) * 7 - 6 = 9 * 7 - 6 = 63 - 6 = 57, which is not 24.\n- Consider (10 - 6) * 7 - 1 = 4 * 7 - 1 = 28 - 1 = 27, which is not 24.\n- Consider (10 - 7)",
