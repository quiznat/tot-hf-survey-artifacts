    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [3, 4, 4, 8], and we must use **each exactly once** to make **24**.\n\nLet\u2019s think step by step.\n\nWe know some common 24 combinations:\n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2192 then we need to neutralize the two 4s (e.g., 4 \u2212 4 = 0, so 8 \u00d7 3 + (4 \u2212 4) = 24). That works!\n- Check: 8 \u00d7 3 + (4 \u2212 4) = 24 + 0 = 24 \u2705\n\nBut let\u2019s verify: uses 8, 3, 4, 4 \u2014 each once. Yes.\n\nAlternative: (8 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but we don\u2019t have 2.\n\nAnother: (4 \u00d7 4) + 8 = 24, but then 3 is unused.\n\nWait \u2014 (4 \u00d7 4) + 8 = 24, but 3 is unused \u2192 invalid.\n\nWhat about (8 \u00f7 (4 \u2212 3)) \u00d7 3? That uses only one 4, one 3, and 8 \u2014 but then second 4 unused.\n\nLet\u2019s try: (8 \u00d7 4) \u2212 (4 \u00d7 3) = 32 \u2212 12 = 20 \u274c\n\n(8 + 4) \u00d7 (4 \u2212 3) = 12 \u00d7 1 = 12 \u274c\n\n(8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24 \u2705 \u2014 uses all numbers: 8, 3, 4, 4.\n\nYes! That\u2019s cleaner: multiplication by 1 (from 4 \u00f7 4) preserves value.\n\nSo: 8 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) = 24.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check order of operations: division and multiplication left to right, but parentheses ensure 4 \u00f7 4 first \u2192 1, then 8 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 = 24.\n\nAll numbers used exactly once.\n\nAlternative form: (8 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (4 \u00f7 4) \u2014 same thing.\n\nWe can write without extra parentheses if we rely on standard precedence, but to be safe and clear, we can include parentheses.\n\nBut the problem just asks",
