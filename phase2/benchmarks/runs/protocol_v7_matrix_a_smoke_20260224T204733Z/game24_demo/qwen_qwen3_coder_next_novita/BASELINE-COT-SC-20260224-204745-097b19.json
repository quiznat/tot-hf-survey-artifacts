    "SAMPLE 9 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [1, 4, 1, 6], and we must use **each number exactly once** to produce **24**.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations:\n\nWe have two 1s, a 4, and a 6.\n\nTry multiplication first \u2014 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, but then we still have two 1s left. We need to incorporate them in a way that doesn\u2019t change the value \u2014 e.g., multiply by (1 + 1) = 2 would double it to 48 \u2014 too big. Multiply by (1 \u00d7 1) = 1 is okay, but we need to use them *somehow* in the expression.\n\nIdea: (6 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 something? 6 + 1 + 1 = 8, then 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 \u2014 but no 3.\n\nHow about (6 \u00d7 4) \u00d7 (1^1) = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24. But exponentiation may be allowed; 1^1 = 1, and uses both 1s. Is exponentiation acceptable? Usually in 24-game, only +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses are standard. Exponents are sometimes allowed but not guaranteed.\n\nLet\u2019s try standard operations only.\n\nTry: (6 \u2212 1) \u00d7 (4 + 1) = 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 \u2014 close.\n\n(6 + 1) \u00d7 (4 \u2212 1) = 7 \u00d7 3 = 21.\n\n(6 \u00d7 1 + 6?) No extra 6.\n\nWhat about division: 6 / (1/4) = 24, but that uses only 6, 1, 4 \u2014 missing one 1.\n\nBut 6 / (1/4) = 24. To incorporate the second 1, maybe: 6 / ((1 + 1)/4) = 6 / (2/4) = 6 / (0.5) = 12 \u2014 too small.\n\nWait: 6 / (1/4) = 24, and we have two 1s. Could we do: 6 / (1/4) \u00d7 1 = 24 \u2014 but that uses only one 1. Need both.\n\nHow about: (6 \u00d7 4) \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1",
