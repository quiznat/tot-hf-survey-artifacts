The problem says \"use each number exactly once to produce 24\", no restriction on operations \u2014 so addition is valid.\n\nAlternative: (7 \u00d7 5) \u2212 (7 + 5) = 35 \u2212 12 = 23 \u274c  \n(7 + 5) \u00d7 (7 \u2212 5) = 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 \u2705  \nWait \u2014 that\u2019s also valid: (7 + 5) \u00d7 (7 \u2212 5) = 12 \u00d7 2 = 24.\n\nIt uses both 7s and both 5s exactly once.\n\nWhich to choose? Both are valid. But maybe the problem expects a more \u201cinteresting\u201d expression than just sum? However, the sum is perfectly valid.\n\nBut note: In the sum, we\u2019re using four numbers \u2014 yes.\n\nLet\u2019s check if the sum respects \u201cexactly once\u201d: two 5s and two 7s \u2014 yes.\n\nBut sometimes puzzles like the \u201c24 Game\u201d require using **exactly four numbers** and **basic operations**, and **each number exactly once** \u2014 and addition is allowed.\n\nHowever, in many 24 Game rules, you must use **all four numbers and exactly",
