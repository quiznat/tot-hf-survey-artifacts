    "SAMPLE 10 OUTPUT: We are given the numbers: [4, 10, 1, 1], and we must use each **exactly once** to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s explore possibilities.\n\nFirst, note that 24 factors:  \n- 4 \u00d7 6  \n- 3 \u00d7 8  \n- 12 \u00d7 2  \n- 24 \u00d7 1  \n- etc.\n\nWe have two 1s, a 4, and a 10.\n\nLet\u2019s consider combining the 1s:  \n- 1 + 1 = 2  \n- 1 \u00d7 1 = 1  \n- 1^1 = 1  \n- 1 \u2212 1 = 0 (not helpful)  \n- 1 / 1 = 1  \n\nUsing 10 and 4:  \n- 10 + 4 = 14  \n- 10 \u2212 4 = 6  \n- 4 \u2212 10 = \u22126  \n- 10 \u00d7 4 = 40  \n- 10 / 4 = 2.5  \n- 4 / 10 = 0.4  \n\nWe need to reach 24.\n\nTry: (10 \u2212 4) = 6.

Not directly.\n\nTry: 10 + 1 + 1 = 12, then 12 \u00d7 2 = 24. Can we get 2 from 4? Yes: 4 / 2 = 2, but no 2. Wait \u2014 we used 10 and both 1s already, leaving 4.
