However, the exact goal is not specified \u2014 typical benchmark tasks with numbers like this often involve computing an expression using all numbers exactly once to reach a target (e.g., 24 game), or computing a summary statistic (e.g., sum, product, etc.). Since no target is given, and only four numbers are provided, a common interpretation is to compute the sum. Let\u2019s compute the sum using the `calc` tool.\n\nACTION: calc 5 + 5 + 7 + 10",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The benchmark task with input [5, 5, 7, 10] is ambiguous without a specified goal. Common interpretations include: (1) computing the sum (27), (2) computing the product (1750), (3) checking if 24 is achievable (24 game), or (4) computing another statistic like average or max. Since no target or operation is given, and the most basic arithmetic operation with a list of numbers is the sum, and the first step already computed the sum as 27, that remains the most reasonable answer unless further context is provided. However, the second step attempted 24-game checks but found no exact 24 \u2014 but since 24 wasn\u2019t specified as the target, that effort may be unnecessary. The safest final answer is the sum: 27.",
