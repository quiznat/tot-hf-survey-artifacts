    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [2, 5, 5, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer what the goal might be. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing a sum, product, or checking for some property (e.g., can we make 24 using arithmetic operations?). Given the numbers [2, 5, 5, 7], a classic 24 game variant is plausible. Let me try to compute possible expressions.\n\nTry: 5 \u00d7 5 = 25, 7 \u2212 2 = 5, then 25 \u2212 5 = 20 \u2014 not 24.  \nTry: (7 \u2212 5) \u00d7 (5 + 2) = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14 \u2014 no.  \nTry: 7 \u00d7",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [2, 5, 5, 7], and the only available tool is `calc`, which likely evaluates arithmetic expressions. Since the task is a benchmark and the numbers resemble those in the \"24 game\", a common goal is to use all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. Let me test plausible expressions using `calc`. I'll try (7 \u2212 5/5) \u00d7 2: 5/5 = 1, 7 \u2212 1 = 6, 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 \u2014 no. Try (5 \u00d7 5) \u2212 (7 \u2212 2) = 25 \u2212 5 = 20 \u2014 no. Try 7 \u00d7 2 + 5 + 5 = 14 + 10 = 24 \u2014 yes! That uses all numbers",
