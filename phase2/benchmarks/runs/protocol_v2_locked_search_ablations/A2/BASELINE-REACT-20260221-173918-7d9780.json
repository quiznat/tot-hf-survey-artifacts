    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [1, 6, 7, 9] and available tool `calc`. However, the task description is ambiguous \u2014 it doesn\u2019t specify what operation or goal to achieve with the numbers. In many benchmark tasks involving a list of numbers and a calculator tool, common goals include:  \n- Compute the sum  \n- Compute the product  \n- Find a target (e.g., 24 game)  \n- Sort or process in some way  \n\nGiven the numbers [1, 6, 7, 9], a classic puzzle is the \"24 game\", where you must use all numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24.
