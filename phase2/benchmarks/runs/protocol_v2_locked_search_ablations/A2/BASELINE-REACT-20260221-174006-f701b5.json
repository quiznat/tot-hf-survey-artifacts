    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [4, 4, 4, 10], and the only available tool is `calc`. This looks like a 24 game-style problem: using the numbers [4, 4, 4, 10] and basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to make 24. Let me try to find such an expression.\n\nFirst, consider possible combinations:\n- 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \u2192 too low.\n- 10 + 4 \u00d7 4 \u2212 4 = 10 + 16 \u2212 4 = 22 \u2192 still 22.\n- (10 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 4) = 6 \u00d7 8 = 48 \u2192 too high.\n- 4",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me continue exploring combinations. Try using division or different groupings.  \n- 4 \u00d7 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 + 8 = 24 \u2014 but we have [4, 4, 4, 10], not three 4s and a 4 \u2014 wait, we *do* have three 4s and a 10. So 4 \u00d7 4 + 4 + 4 would need four 4s, but we only have three.  \n- What about (10 \u00d7 4 \u2212 4 \u00d7 4) = 40 \u2212 16 = 24! That uses 10, 4, 4, 4 \u2014 exactly the numbers.
