    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [1, 1, 4, 8], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation or goal is given, I need to infer what might be expected. Common benchmark tasks with lists of numbers include computing a sum, product, or perhaps forming an expression that evaluates to a target (like 24). Let\u2019s consider possible interpretations.\n\nGiven numbers: [1, 1, 4, 8]\n\nTry to reach 24?

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The input is [1, 1, 4, 8], and the goal is likely to form an expression using all numbers exactly once (as in the 24 game) that evaluates to 24. I found that (8 + 4) \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 works. To confirm, I should compute it using the `calc` tool. The expression is \"(8 + 4) * (1 + 1)\".",
