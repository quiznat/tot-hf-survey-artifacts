    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 7, 8, 9]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer what might be expected. Common benchmark tasks with lists include computing sum, product, average, or checking for specific properties (e.g., sorted, primes, etc.). Given the tools available are only `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations, the most straightforward task is to compute a basic aggregate \u2014 perhaps the sum or product.\n\nLet me compute the sum: 2 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 26. I can verify this using the `calc` tool.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 7 + 8 + 9",

Since the task was not explicitly specified, and the sum is a natural first interpretation for a list of numbers with only arithmetic tools available, this result is likely the intended answer. I should now finalize with the sum.\nFINAL: 26"
