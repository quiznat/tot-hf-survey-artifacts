    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [4, 7, 9, 10]. The available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. However, the task description doesn\u2019t specify what operation to perform \u2014 it's a benchmark task, so perhaps the goal is to compute something standard like sum, product, or maybe find a pattern or result based on these numbers.\n\nLet\u2019s consider common benchmark tasks: maybe compute the sum: 4 + 7 + 9 + 10 = 30. Or maybe compute something else like average (7.5), or perhaps evaluate an expression using these numbers in order.\n\nSince no explicit instruction is given, and the only tool is `calc`, I should try to compute something meaningful. The most straightforward is the sum.\n\nLet me use `calc` to compute the sum.\n\nACTION: calc 4 + 7 + 9 + 10",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The calculation returned 30, which is the sum of the numbers. Since the task is a benchmark and no specific operation was given, sum is a reasonable default. However, I should verify if there's another common interpretation \u2014 e.g., maybe the task expects a different operation like product (4\u00d77\u00d79\u00d710 = 2520), or perhaps a more complex expression. But without further instructions, sum is simplest and matches the most common interpretation for such inputs. Since the result 30 is clean and plausible, I'll consider this complete.\n\nFINAL: 30"
