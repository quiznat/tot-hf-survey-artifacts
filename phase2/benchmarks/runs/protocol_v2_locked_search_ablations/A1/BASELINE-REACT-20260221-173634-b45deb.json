    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [2, 5, 5, 7], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing sum, product, or checking for some property. Given the numbers [2, 5, 5, 7], a likely goal is to compute their sum: 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 19. Alternatively, maybe it's to compute something like the result of applying operations in order (e.g., 2 + 5 * 5 - 7), but order of operations matters. However, without explicit instructions, the safest assumption is to compute the sum, as it's the most standard arithmetic operation for a list. Let me verify: 2 + 5 = 7,",
