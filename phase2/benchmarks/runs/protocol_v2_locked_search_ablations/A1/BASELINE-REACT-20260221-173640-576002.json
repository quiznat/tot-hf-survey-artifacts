    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the numbers [1, 5, 5, 9] and the calc tool. Since no specific target or operation is given, this is likely the classic \"24 game\" where the goal is to use all four numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to make 24. Let me try to find such an expression.\n\nLet\u2019s explore combinations:\n- 9 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 20 \u2192 too low\n- 9 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 1) \u2212 5 = 9\u00d74 \u22125 = 36\u22125 = 31 \u2192 too high\n- (9 \u2212 5) \u00d7 (5 + 1) = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 \u2192 YES!
