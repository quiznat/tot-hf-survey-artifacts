    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 4, 4, 5]. Since the task is not explicitly stated, I need to infer what is expected. Common benchmark tasks with lists include computing the sum, average, product, or perhaps checking for duplicates. Given the presence of duplicate 4s, maybe the task is to compute the sum or average. Let me compute the sum first using the calc tool.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 4 + 4 + 5",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the list [2, 4, 4, 5] is 15. However, since the task wasn't explicitly specified, I should consider other common interpretations. For example, the average would be 15 / 4 = 3.75. But without explicit instructions, the most straightforward and common benchmark task for a numeric list is often the sum. Since I've already computed the sum as 15, and no further clarification is available, I'll proceed with that as the answer.",
