    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop with input [6, 6, 8, 9] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to combine the numbers using arithmetic operations to reach a target (e.g., 24 game). Let\u2019s assume the goal is to make 24 using all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses.\n\nNumbers: 6, 6, 8, 9  \nTry combinations:\n\n- 9 - 6 = 3; 8 - 6 = 2; 3 \u00d7 8 = 24?

Let\u2019s explore other combinations:\n\n- Try (6 + 6) \u00d7 (9 \u2212 8) = 12 \u00d7 1 = 12 \u2192 too small  \n- Try 9 \u00d7 (8 \u00f7 (6 \u00f7 6)) = 9 \u00d7 (8 \u00f7 1) = 72 \u2192 too big  \n- Try (6 \u00d7 6) \u2212 (9 \u2212 8) = 36 \u2212 1 = 35  \n- Try (8 \u2212 6) \u00d7 (9 + 6) = 2",
