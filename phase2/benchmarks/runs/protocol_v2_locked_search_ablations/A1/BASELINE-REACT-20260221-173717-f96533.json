    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using the ReAct loop. The input is [1, 6, 6, 6], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, the most likely interpretation is to compute some expression using these numbers \u2014 perhaps to reach a target (e.g., 24 game), or compute sum, product, etc. Let\u2019s consider common benchmarks: the 24 game uses four numbers and basic operations to reach 24. With [1, 6, 6, 6], can we make 24? Try: 6 \u00d7 6 \u2212 6 \u00d7 1 = 36 \u2212 6 = 30 \u2192 too high. 6 \u00d7 (6 \u2212 1) \u2212 6 = 6\u00d75 \u2212 6 = 30 \u2212 6 = 24 \u2192 yes! That uses all numbers",
