    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [1, 1, 2, 7], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., compute a sum, find a pattern, etc.), I need to infer the likely intent. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve computing the sum, product, or applying some arithmetic operation. Given the numbers [1, 1, 2, 7], a plausible interpretation is to compute their sum: 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 = 11. Alternatively, it could be a puzzle (e.g., using operations to reach a target), but without a target, sum is simplest. I\u2019ll use `calc` to compute the sum.\n\nACTION: calc 1 + 1 + 2 + 7",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 11",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The calculation returned 11, which is the sum of the numbers [1, 1, 2, 7]. Since the task was ambiguous but the most straightforward interpretation (summing the list) yields a clean result, and no further instructions were given, this is likely the intended solution. I can now conclude the task.\n\nFINAL: 11"
