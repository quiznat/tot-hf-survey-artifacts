    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [3, 3, 4, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with 4 numbers involve making 24 using arithmetic operations (24 game). Let me try to compute possible expressions using 3, 3, 4, 7 to reach 24.\n\nPossible approach: Try combinations. For example:\n- 7 - 3 = 4, then 4 * 4 = 16, 16 + 3 = 19 \u2192 no.\n- 3 + 3 = 6, 7 - 4 = 3, 6 * 3 = 18 \u2192 no.\n- (7 + 3) * (4 - 3) = 10 * 1 =",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is likely the 24 game: use all four numbers [3, 3, 4, 7] exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. Let me systematically test combinations. Try (7 \u2212 3) \u00d7 (3 + 3) = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 \u2014 but that uses only one 4, not the 4. Wait, numbers are [3, 3, 4, 7], so (7 \u2212 3) \u00d7 (3 + 3) uses 7, 3, 3, 3 \u2014 extra 3, invalid. Try (7 + 3) \u00d7 3 \u2212 4 = 10 \u00d7 3 \u2212 4 = 30 \u2212 4 = 26 \u2014 close. Try 7 \u00d7 3 + 3 = 24",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Let me reconsider. The numbers are [3, 3, 4, 7]. I need to use all four exactly once. Try: (7 \u2212 3) \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u2014 but no 2. Try 3 \u00d7 (7 + 3) \u2212 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 = 26. Try 4 \u00d7 (7 \u2212 3) + 3 = 4 \u00d7 4 + 3 = 19. Try (3 \u00d7 7) + (4 \u2212 3) = 21 + 1 = 22. Try (3 + 3) \u00d7 4 = 24 \u2014 but that uses only 3, 3, 4, missing 7. Need to incorporate 7. Try (7 \u00d7 3) + 3 = 24, but again missing 4.",
    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: Let me try more systematically. We need to use all four numbers: 3, 3, 4, 7 exactly once. Try division: 7 \u2212 (3 \u00f7 3) = 6, then 6 \u00d7 4 = 24. Yes! That uses all numbers: (7 \u2212 (3 \u00f7 3)) \u00d7 4 = (7 \u2212 1) \u00d7 4 = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24. Let me verify with the calc tool.",
