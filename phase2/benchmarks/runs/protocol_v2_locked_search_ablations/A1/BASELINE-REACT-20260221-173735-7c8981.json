Let\u2019s verify with `calc`: 2 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 14. Alternatively, maybe it's 2 * 3 + 3 * 6 = 6 + 18 = 24 \u2014 that\u2019s promising! Let\u2019s test that: 2*3 + 3*6 = 6 + 18 =",

This is a valid 24 solution: (2 \u00d7 3) + (3 \u00d7 6) = 6 + 18 = 24. Since `calc` can evaluate expressions, I should compute this to confirm.",
