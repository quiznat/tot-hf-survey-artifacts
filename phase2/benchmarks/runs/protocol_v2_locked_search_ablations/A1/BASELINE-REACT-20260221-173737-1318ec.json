    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [1, 1, 5, 5]. This looks like a 24 game-style puzzle where we need to use the numbers 1, 1, 5, 5 and basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses) to make 24. Let me think of possible combinations.\n\nWe have two 1s and two 5s.\n\nSome known tricks: 5 \u00d7 5 = 25, and 25 \u2212 1 = 24, but we have two 1s, so maybe 5 \u00d7 5 \u2212 1 \u00d7 1 = 25 \u2212 1 = 24. That works!\n\nLet me verify: 5 \u00d7 5 = 25, 1 \u00d7 1 = 1, 25 \u2212 1 = 24. Yes, (5 \u00d7 5) \u2212",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task input is [1, 1, 5, 5]. This resembles a 24 game puzzle, where we must use all four numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to reach 24. A promising candidate is (5 \u00d7 5) \u2212 (1 \u00d7 1) = 25 \u2212 1 = 24. This uses all numbers and yields 24. To confirm correctness, I should compute it using the calc tool.",
