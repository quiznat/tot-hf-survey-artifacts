Since the task description is minimal, I infer the goal is likely the classic 24 game: use all four numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. Let me try promising combinations.\n\nTry: (9 \u2212 6) \u00d7 (8 \u2212 6) = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 \u2192 too small.  \nTry: 6 \u00d7 6 = 36; 36 \u2212 9 = 27; 27 \u2212 8 = 19 \u2192 no.  \nTry: 8 \u00d7 6 = 48; 48 \u00f7 6 = 8; 8 + 9 = 17 \u2192 no.  \nTry: (6",

Try 8 \u00d7 (9 \u2212 6) = 24 \u2014 that\u2019s 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, but we still have a 6 left unused. Need to use all four numbers. Can we incorporate the extra 6 via \u00d71 or +0?
