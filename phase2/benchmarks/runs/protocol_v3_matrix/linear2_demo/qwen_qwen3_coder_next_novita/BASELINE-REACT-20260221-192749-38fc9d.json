    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [a, b, c] representing equations like ax + by = c. So we have:\nEquation 1: -7x + 3y = 87  \nEquation 2: -6x - 1y = 46  \n\nWe need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a system of two linear equations. Let me try that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-7, 3, 87], [-6, -1, 46]]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool returned x = -9.0 and y = 8.0 as the solution to the system of equations. To verify correctness, I should use the `check_xy` tool to plug these values back into both original equations and confirm they hold true.\n\nACTION: check_xy -9 8 [[-7, 3, 87], [-6, -1, 46]]\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: Both equations are satisfied:  \n-7*(-9) + 3*8 = 63 + 24 = 87 \u2714  \n-6*(-9) + (-1)*8 = 54 - 8 = 46 \u2714\n\nTHINK: The verification confirms that x = -9 and y = 8 satisfy both equations exactly. The solution is correct.\n\nFINAL: x=-9,y=8"
