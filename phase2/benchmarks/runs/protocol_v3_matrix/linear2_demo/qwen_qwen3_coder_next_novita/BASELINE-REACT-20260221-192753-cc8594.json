    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays: [1, -8, -29] and [-1, -9, -39]. These likely represent quadratic equations of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. So the equations are:\n1) x\u00b2 - 8x - 29 = 0  \n2) -x\u00b2 - 9x - 39 = 0 (or equivalently, x\u00b2 + 9x + 39 = 0 after multiplying by -1)\n\nBut the task may be to find integer solutions (x, y) satisfying both equations \u2014 perhaps they are part of a system? However, the equations as written are univariate quadratics. Alternatively, maybe the equations are linear in two variables, but only one coefficient vector is given per equation \u2014 that seems unlikely.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the equations are of the form ax + by =",
