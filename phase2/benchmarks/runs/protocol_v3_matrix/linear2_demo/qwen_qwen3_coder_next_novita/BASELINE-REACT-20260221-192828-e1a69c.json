    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations.

Let's consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2x2 system. Alternatively, `check_xy` might verify a candidate solution. Since I don\u2019t yet have a candidate, I should try `solve2` first.  \n\nInput format for `solve2` is likely the list of equations as given.
