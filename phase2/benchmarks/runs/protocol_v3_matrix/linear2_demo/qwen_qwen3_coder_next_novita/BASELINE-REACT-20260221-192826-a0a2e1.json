    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \na1*x + b1*y = c1  \na2*x + b2*y = c2  \n\nSo here:  \n8x - 4y = -60  \n-6x + 5y = 47  \n\nI need to find x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2-variable linear system. The input format for `solve2` is probably the coefficient matrix and constants \u2014 possibly as a list of equations or matrix form. Given the input is already in the form [[8, -4, -60], [-6, 5",

Since `solve2` is designed for 2-variable systems and the input format matches typical linear system representation (coefficients + constant term per equation), I should try `solve2` first. The input should be passed as the list of equations: [[8, -4, -60], [-6, 5, 47]].",

Since `solve2` is explicitly designed for this task and the input format matches the expected structure (list of [a, b, c] for ax + by = c), I should call `solve2` with the given equations.
