    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form [a, b, c], likely representing linear equations of the form a*x + b*y = c. So we have:\n1) 7x + 7y = -21  \n2) 8x - 4y = -96  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve this system. Let's try to simplify and solve manually first.\n\nEquation 1: 7x + 7y = -21 \u2192 divide both sides by 7: x + y = -3 \u2192 so y = -3 - x.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:  \n8x - 4(-3 - x) = -96  \n8x + 12 + 4x = -96  \n12x + 12 = -96  \n12",

Alternatively, use `solve2` which is likely designed for this exact task (solving 2 linear equations). Since `solve2` is available and directly applicable, we should use it to get the solution reliably.\nACTION: solve2 [[7, 7, -21], [8, -4, -96]]",
