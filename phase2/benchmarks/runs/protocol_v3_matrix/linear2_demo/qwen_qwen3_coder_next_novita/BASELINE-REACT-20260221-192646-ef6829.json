    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task provides a system of two linear equations in two variables, represented as coefficients and constants:  \nEquation 1: -8x - 3y = -66  \nEquation 2: 1x - 8y = -42  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` (to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2x2 system directly). Since `solve2` is designed for this purpose, I should use it first.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-8, -3, -66], [1, -8, -42]]",
