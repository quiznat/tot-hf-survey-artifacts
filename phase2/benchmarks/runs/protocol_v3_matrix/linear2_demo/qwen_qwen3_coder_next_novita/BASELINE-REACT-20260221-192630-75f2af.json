    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficients: [-1, 6, -16] and [-1, -9, 14]. These likely represent quadratic equations of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where each list is [a, b, c]. So the equations are:\n1. -x\u00b2 + 6x - 16 = 0\n2. -x\u00b2 - 9x + 14 = 0\n\nWe need to solve these equations. The available tools are `check_xy` and `solve2`. Since `solve2` likely solves a system of two equations (given the name), and we have two equations, that seems appropriate. Let\u2019s use `solve2` with the two equations.\n\nBut first, confirm: `solve2` probably expects the equations in a specific format \u2014 maybe as lists of coefficients or as strings. Since the",

The goal is likely to find solutions (e.g., real roots or integer solutions). Since `solve2` is available and suggests solving a system of two equations, but these are two *separate* quadratic equations (not a system), we may need to solve each individually. However, `solve2` might be designed to solve a *system* of two equations in two variables (e.g., x and y), but the input only gives coefficients for single-variable quadratics.
