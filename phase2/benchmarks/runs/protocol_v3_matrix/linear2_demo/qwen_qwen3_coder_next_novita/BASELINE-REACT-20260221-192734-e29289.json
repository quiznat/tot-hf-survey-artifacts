    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the form [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n-1\u00b7x + 2\u00b7y = -15  \n3\u00b7x - 5\u00b7y = 41  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can either use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or use the provided tools. Let\u2019s consider using `solve2`, which likely solves a 2\u00d72 linear system. If not, I can use `check_xy` to verify candidate solutions. First, try `solve2` with the coefficient matrix and constants.\n\nTool input format for `solve2` is likely the augmented matrix or separate coefficient and constant arrays. Given the structure, I\u2019ll pass the equations as [[-1, 2], [3",

Since the equations are given as [[-1, 2, -15], [3, -5, 41]], each row is [a, b, c] for ax + by = c. So the coefficient matrix is [[-1, 2], [3, -5]] and constants are [-15, 41]. I should try `solve2` with the full augmented form or split form. Let\u2019s assume `solve2` accepts the list of equations as provided \u2014 i.e., [[-1, 2, -15], [3, -5, 41]]. I\u2019ll call `solve2` with that",

Since I don\u2019t yet know the exact input format for `solve2`, and previous attempts didn\u2019t trigger action, I should try solving manually first to get a candidate solution, then verify with `check_xy`.  \n\nLet\u2019s solve algebraically:  \nFrom first equation: -x + 2y = -15 \u2192 x = 2y + 15  \nSubstitute into second: 3(2y + 15) - 5y = 41 \u2192 6y + 45 - 5y = 4",
