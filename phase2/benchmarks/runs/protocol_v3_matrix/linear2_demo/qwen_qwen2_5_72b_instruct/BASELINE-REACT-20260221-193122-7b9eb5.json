    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The given task is to solve a system of linear equations. We have two equations in the form of lists where each list represents an equation in the form [a, b, c] corresponding to ax + by = c. Given that we have two equations and presumably two unknowns (x and y), we can use the provided `solve2` tool which is likely designed to solve systems of two linear equations. I will proceed with using this tool to find the solution for x and y.\n\nACTION: solve2 [-5, 7, -41] [5, 7, -1]",
