    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the numbers [3, 8, 13, 14, 14, 20] that sums to the target 39. I need to use the available tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a list sums to the target. Let me first try some combinations manually or via systematic testing. Since there are only 6 numbers, I can try combinations of 2 or 3 numbers. Let's try the largest numbers first: 20 + 14 + 14 = 48 (too big), 20 + 14 + 13 = 47, 20 + 14 + 8 = 42, 20 + 14 + 3 = 37, 20 + 13 +",
