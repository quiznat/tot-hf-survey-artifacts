    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the numbers [5, 5, 10, 12, 18, 19] that sums to the target 36. I can use the `sum_list` tool to check sums of candidate subsets, and `check_target` to verify if a subset sums exactly to the target. Let me start by trying some combinations.\n\nFirst, note the total sum: 5 + 5 + 10 + 12 + 18 + 19 = 69. So we need a subset summing to 36, meaning the complement would sum to 33.\n\nTry large numbers first: 19 + 18 = 37 \u2192 too big. 19 + 12 = 31, need 5 more \u2192 31 + 5 = 36. We have two 5",
