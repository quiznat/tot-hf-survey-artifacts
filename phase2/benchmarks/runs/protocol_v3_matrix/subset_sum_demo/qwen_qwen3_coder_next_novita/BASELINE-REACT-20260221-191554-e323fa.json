    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the numbers [2, 2, 6, 11, 14] that sums to the target 17. I can use the `sum_list` tool to check sums of candidate subsets, and `check_target` to verify if a subset sums to the target. Let me try some combinations.\n\nFirst, try the largest number: 14. 17 - 14 = 3. Is there a subset that sums to 3? We have 2 and 2 \u2014 2 + 2 = 4, too big; single 2 is 2, not enough. So 14 alone won\u2019t work.\n\nTry 11: 17 - 11 = 6. We have a 6! So 11 + 6 = 17. That\u2019s a valid subset: [11,",
