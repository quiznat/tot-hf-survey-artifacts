    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 24 using the numbers [2, 4, 10, 11, 12] and the available tools: `sum_list` and `check_target`. Since only `sum_list` and `check_target` are available, and no arithmetic operations (like subtraction, multiplication, division) are explicitly provided, I suspect the intended solution may involve selecting a subset of numbers whose sum equals 24. Let\u2019s try summing subsets.\n\nFirst, try summing all numbers: 2 + 4 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 39 \u2192 too high.\n\nTry excluding one number:\n- Exclude 2: 4+10+11+12 = 37\n- Exclude 4: 2+10+11+12 = 35\n- Exclude 10:",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let's continue exploring subset sums. Excluding 10 gives 2+4+11+12 = 29. Excluding 11 gives 2+4+10+12 = 28. Excluding 12 gives 2+4+10+11 = 27. All still too high. Try excluding two numbers:  \n- Exclude 2 and 4: 10+11+12 = 33  \n- Exclude 2 and 10: 4+11+12 = 27  \n- Exclude 2 and 11: 4+10+12 = 26  \n- Exclude 2 and 12: 4+10+11 = 25  \n- Exclude 4 and 10: 2+11+12 = 2",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: Wait \u2014 I made a mistake in the last line: excluding 4 and 10 gives 2 + 11 + 12 = 25, not 2. Let me continue systematically. Try excluding three numbers (i.e., using only two numbers):  \n- 2 + 4 = 6  \n- 2 + 10 = 12  \n- 2 + 11 = 13  \n- 2 + 12 = 14  \n- 4 + 10 = 14  \n- 4 + 11 = 15  \n- 4 + 12 = 16  \n- 10 + 11 = 21  \n- 10 + 12 = 22  \n- 11 + 12 = 23  \n\nClosest so far: 11 + 1",

    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: I made a typo \u2014 11 + 12 = 23, which is 1 short of 24. Let\u2019s try three-number combinations more carefully. From earlier, excluding two numbers (i.e., using three numbers):  \n- 2 + 4 + 10 = 16  \n- 2 + 4 + 11 = 17  \n- 2 + 4 + 12 = 18  \n- 2 + 10 + 11 = 23  \n- 2 + 10 + 12 = 24 \u2192 bingo!  \nSo 2 + 10 + 12 = 24.

    "STEP 5 MODEL: THINK: I have identified that 2 + 10 + 12 = 24. To confirm, I should use `sum_list([2, 10, 12])` to compute the sum, then use `check_target` with the result and target 24.\nACTION: sum_list [2, 10, 12]\nACTION: check_target 24",
