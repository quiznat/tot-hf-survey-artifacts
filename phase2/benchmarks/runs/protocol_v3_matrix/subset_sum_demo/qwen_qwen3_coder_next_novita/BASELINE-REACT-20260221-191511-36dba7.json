    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the numbers [5, 9, 10, 17, 20] that sums to the target 30. I can use the `sum_list` tool to check sums of candidate subsets, and `check_target` to verify if a sum equals the target. Let me start by trying some combinations. First, try the full list: 5 + 9 + 10 + 17 + 20 = 61, too big. Try smaller subsets. Let's try 10 + 20 = 30 \u2014 that matches the target! So the subset [10, 20] sums to 30. I should verify this with the tools. First, compute the sum using `sum_list`, then check if it equals the target using `check_target`. But `check_target` likely takes a list and checks",

To confirm, I need to compute the sum using `sum_list` and then verify against the target using `check_target`. Since `sum_list` likely returns the sum of a list, and `check_target` probably takes a list and checks if its sum equals the target (or maybe takes a sum value and compares), I should first get the sum of [10, 20] using `sum_list`, then use `check_target` with that result or directly with the list.
