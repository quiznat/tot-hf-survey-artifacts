    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the given numbers [1, 3, 4, 8, 11, 11, 16] that sums to the target 27. I need to use the available tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a list sums to the target. Let me start by trying some combinations. First, I'll try the largest numbers: 16 + 11 = 27 \u2014 that's exactly the target! But there are two 11s, so using 16 + 11 (one of them) works. Let me verify using `check_target` with [16, 11].",

I should now use `check_target` with input [16, 11] to verify this subset meets the target.\nACTION: check_target [16, 11]",
