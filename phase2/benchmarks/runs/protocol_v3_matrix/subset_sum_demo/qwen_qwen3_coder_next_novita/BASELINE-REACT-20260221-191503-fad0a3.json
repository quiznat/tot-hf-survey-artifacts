    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the given numbers [3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17] that sums to the target 39. I need to use the available tools: `sum_list` to compute the sum of a list, and `check_target` to verify if a list sums to the target. Let me start by trying some combinations. First, I'll try the full list sum to see how close it is.\n\nACTION: sum_list [3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The full list sums to 59, which is 20 more than the target 39. So I need to find a subset that sums to 39. Since 59 - 39 = 20, I could try removing elements that sum to 20 from the full list. Let\u2019s consider possible subsets. Alternatively, I can try building subsets incrementally. Let\u2019s try a few combinations. For example, 17 + 14 = 31, and 39 - 31 = 8, and 8 is in the list! So [17, 14, 8] sums to 39. Let me verify using sum_list.\nACTION: sum_list [17, 14, 8]",
