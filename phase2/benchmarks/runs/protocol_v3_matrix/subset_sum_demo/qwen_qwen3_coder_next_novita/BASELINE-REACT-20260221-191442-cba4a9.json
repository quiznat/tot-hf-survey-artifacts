    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find a subset of the numbers [1, 3, 6, 9, 11] that sums to the target 27. I can use the `sum_list` tool to compute the sum of any subset, and `check_target` to verify if a subset sums to the target. Let me first try the sum of all numbers: 1 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 11 = 30, which is more than 27. So I need to exclude some numbers. Let me try subsets systematically. First, try the full list to see its sum.\nACTION: sum_list [1, 3, 6, 9, 11]",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of all numbers is 30, which is 3 more than the target 27. So I need to find a subset that excludes numbers summing to exactly 3. Looking at the list [1, 3, 6, 9, 11], the number 3 itself sums to 3, so excluding 3 gives a subset [1, 6, 9, 11] with sum 30 - 3 = 27. Let me verify this subset using `sum_list`.\nACTION: sum_list [1, 6, 9, 11]",
