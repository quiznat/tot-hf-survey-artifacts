    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find a subset of the given numbers that sums to the target value of 11.

The most efficient approach would be to use the sum_list tool to test various subsets and check_target to verify if they equal 11.\n\nLet me start by trying some simple combinations:\n- Single number: 11 is not in the list\n- Two numbers: 2+9=11, 3+8=11,",
