Let me analyze the available tools and approach this systematically.\n\nI have:\n- numbers: [3, 10, 12, 14, 14, 18]\n- target: 26\n\nThe tools available are:\n1. check_target - likely verifies if a sum equals the target\n2. sum_list - likely sums a list of numbers\n\nI should try different combinations of numbers to see which ones sum to 26. Let me start by checking some obvious combinations.\n\nACTION: sum_list [10, 12, 14]\nTHINK: Let me try adding 10 + 12 + 14 = 36, which is too high.
