However, before doing that, it might be useful to check if there's a direct match for the target in the list itself.\nACTION: check_target 28 [4, 5, 9, 14, 19]",

A systematic approach would be to start with the largest number and work my way down, or to use a more brute-force method by trying out different combinations.\n\nACTION: sum_list [19, 9]",
