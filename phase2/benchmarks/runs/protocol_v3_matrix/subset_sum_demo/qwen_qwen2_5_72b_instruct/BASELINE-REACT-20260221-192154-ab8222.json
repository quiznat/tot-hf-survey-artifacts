    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to reach the target number 24 using the numbers provided in the list. I can use the `sum_list` tool to add up numbers in the list and then use `check_target` to see if we have reached the target. However, simply adding all the numbers might not give us the target, so we need to consider different combinations of the numbers.\n\nACTION: sum_list [1, 3, 4, 7, 10]",
