    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is a list of numbers: [4, 7, 9, 10]. However, the task description does not specify what operation or goal to achieve with these numbers. Since the only available tool is `calc`, I should consider common benchmark tasks involving lists of numbers \u2014 such as computing the sum, product, average, or perhaps forming an expression that evaluates to a target (like 24).
