    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [2, 4, 4, 8], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, I need to infer what the task might be. Common benchmark tasks with lists of numbers include computing the sum, product, mean, or checking for patterns. Given the numbers [2, 4, 4, 8], a likely task is to compute the sum: 2 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 18. Alternatively, it could be the product: 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 8 = 256. But without explicit instructions, the most standard interpretation is to compute the sum. I'll use the `calc` tool to compute the sum.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 4 + 4 + 8",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The calculation returned 18, which is the sum of the numbers [2, 4, 4, 8]. Since the task was ambiguous and no specific operation was given, and the sum is a reasonable and common interpretation for such benchmark tasks, this result is likely correct. I should now finalize the answer.\nFINAL: 18"
