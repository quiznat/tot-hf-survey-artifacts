    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input is a list of numbers: [2, 4, 5, 10]. The available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since the task is not explicitly specified, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with a list of numbers include computing the sum, product, average, or identifying a pattern. Given the numbers, a likely task is to compute the sum: 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 21. Alternatively, maybe it's to compute the product: 2\u00d74\u00d75\u00d710 = 400. Or perhaps find the median, min, max, etc. But without explicit instructions, the most standard interpretation for such a benchmark is to compute the sum. I\u2019ll use `calc` to compute the sum.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 4 + 5 + 10",
