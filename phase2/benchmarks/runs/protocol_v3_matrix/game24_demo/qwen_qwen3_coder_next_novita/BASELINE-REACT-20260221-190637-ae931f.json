    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [4, 4, 4, 10] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal \u2014 likely to combine the numbers [4, 4, 4, 10] using arithmetic operations to reach a target (commonly 24 in \"24 game\" puzzles). Let\u2019s test if that\u2019s the case.\n\nWe have numbers: 4, 4, 4, 10  \nTry combinations:  \n- 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \u2192 too low  \n- 10 \u00d7 4 \u2212 4 \u2212 4 = 40 \u2212 8 = 32  \n- (10 \u2212 4) \u00d7 (4 + 4) = 6 \u00d7 8 = 48",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is likely the classic 24 game: use [4, 4, 4, 10] with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24. Let\u2019s explore systematically.  \nWe know 4 \u00d7 4 + 4 + 4 = 24, but we have a 10 instead of a fourth 4. Try:  \n- 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22  \n- 10 \u00d7 4 \u2212 4 \u00d7 4 = 40 \u2212 16 = 24 \u2192 YES! That uses all four numbers: 10, 4, 4, 4.  \nSo expression: 10 \u00d7 4 \u2212 4 \u00d7 4 = 40 \u2212 16 = 24.  \nLet\u2019s verify with calc tool.\nACTION: calc",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: error: unsafe expression",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The calc tool rejected the expression as \"unsafe\", likely due to formatting or operator precedence concerns. I need to format the expression clearly, possibly with explicit parentheses to avoid ambiguity. Let\u2019s try rewriting the expression: (10 * 4) - (4 * 4). This should evaluate to 40 - 16 = 24 and be unambiguous.\nACTION: calc (10 * 4) - (4 * 4)",
