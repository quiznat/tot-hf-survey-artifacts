    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [2, 3, 9, 9], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific task is given (e.g., compute sum, product, find pattern), I need to infer the most likely benchmark task \u2014 often it's to compute the result of an expression using the numbers in order, possibly with operations like +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses, etc. But with only `calc` available, I should try to compute something meaningful.\n\nA common puzzle with four numbers is the \"24 game\", where you try to make 24 using all four numbers exactly once with basic operations.
