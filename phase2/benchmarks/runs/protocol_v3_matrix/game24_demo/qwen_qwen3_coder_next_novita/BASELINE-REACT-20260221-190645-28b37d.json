    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [4, 5, 5, 7], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific operation is given, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with number lists include computing sum, product, average, or checking for patterns. Given the list [4, 5, 5, 7], a likely goal is to compute the sum. Let me calculate the sum using the `calc` tool.\n\nACTION: calc 4 + 5 + 5 + 7",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of [4, 5, 5, 7] is 21, as computed. However, benchmark tasks sometimes expect other operations\u2014e.g., average, product, or identifying duplicates. Since there are two 5s, maybe the task is to compute the mean: 21 / 4 = 5.25. Or perhaps it's to find the mode (5), median (5), or range (3). Without explicit instructions, sum is the most straightforward interpretation, especially given the simplicity of the input and tool. Since the ReAct loop has produced a result (21) and no further instructions contradict this, I'll conclude with the sum as the answer.\n\nFINAL: 21"
