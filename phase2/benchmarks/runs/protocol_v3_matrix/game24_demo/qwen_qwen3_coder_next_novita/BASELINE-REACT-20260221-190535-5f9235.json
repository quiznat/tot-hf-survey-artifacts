    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop with input [3, 3, 4, 7] and available tool `calc`. Since the task description is minimal, I need to infer the goal. Common benchmark tasks with numbers like this involve forming the number 24 using arithmetic operations (24 game). Let me verify if [3, 3, 4, 7] can form 24.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- 7 - 3 = 4, then 4 * 4 = 16, 16 + 3 = 19 \u2192 no\n- (7 + 3) * (4 - 3) = 10 * 1 = 10 \u2192 no\n- 3 * 7 = 21, 21 + 4 - 3 = 22 \u2192 no\n- 3 * 3",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is likely the 24 game: using [3, 3, 4, 7] and basic arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, parentheses), form 24. Let me systematically test combinations. Try (7 - 3) \u00d7 (3 + 3) = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 \u2014 but we only have two 3s, and that uses both 3s and the 7 and 4? Wait: (7 - 3) uses 7 and one 3, (3 + 3) would need two 3s \u2014 but we only have two 3s total, so (7 - 3) uses one 3, leaving one 3 for (3 + 3) \u2014 impossible. Let's re-express: (7 - 3) = 4, then 4 \u00d7 (3 + 3)",

Try another: 3 \u00d7 (7 + 3) - 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 - 4 = 30 - 4 = 26 \u2192 no. Try 4 \u00d7 7 - 3 - 3 = 28 - 6 = 22 \u2192 no. Try (3 \u00d7 7) + (4 - 3) = 21 + 1 = 22. Try (3 + 3) \u00d7 4 = 24",

So that's invalid. Let's try involving the 7: (7 \u00d7 3) + (4 - 3) = 21 + 1 = 22. (7 + 3) \u00d7 3 - 4 = 10 \u00d7 3 - 4 = 30 - 4 = 26. (7 \u00d7 4) - (3 + 3) = 28 - 6 = 22. (7 - 3/3) \u00d7 4 = (7 - 1) \u00d7 4 = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 \u2014 yes! This uses all",
