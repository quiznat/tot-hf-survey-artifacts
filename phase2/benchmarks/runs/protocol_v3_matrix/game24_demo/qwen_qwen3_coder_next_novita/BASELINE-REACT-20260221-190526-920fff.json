    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is a list of numbers: [1, 5, 8, 8]. The only available tool is `calc`, which likely performs arithmetic calculations. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., \"make 24\"), I need to infer the task. A common benchmark task with 4 numbers is the \"24 game\", where you must use all numbers exactly once with +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7, and parentheses to make 24.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find an expression using [1, 5, 8, 8] to make 24.\n\nTry combinations:\n- 8 \u00d7 (5 \u2212 1) = 32 \u2192 too high, and we still have an 8.\n- (8 + 8) \u00d7 (5 \u2212 1) = 16 \u00d7 4 =",
