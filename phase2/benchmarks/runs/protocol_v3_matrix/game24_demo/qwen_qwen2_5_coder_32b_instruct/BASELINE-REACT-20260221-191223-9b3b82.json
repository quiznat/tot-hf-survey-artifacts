    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve this benchmark task using the available tools. The task input is [2, 2, 6, 6] and I have access to a calculator tool called \"calc\". Since there's no specific operation mentioned, I should try to find a meaningful mathematical relationship or pattern with these numbers.\n\nLooking at the numbers [2, 2, 6, 6], I notice they form pairs of identical numbers.

This suggests there might be a consistent result from different operations on these numbers.
