    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to solve a benchmark task with the input [6, 6, 8, 9]. Since I only have access to a calculator tool and no specific instruction on what calculation to perform, I should look for a common mathematical operation that would be meaningful with these numbers. A typical benchmark task might involve finding the sum, product, or some combination. Let me try calculating the sum first as it's the most straightforward approach.\n\nACTION: calc 6 + 6 + 8 + 9\n\nFINAL: 29",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: I've calculated the sum of the numbers [6, 6, 8, 9] and got 29. However, let me consider if there might be another interpretation of this benchmark task. The numbers could represent coordinates, dimensions, or part of a more complex calculation. But without additional instructions, the most logical first step is to compute the sum. Let me double-check by adding them again: 6 + 6 = 12, then 12 + 8 = 20, then 20 + 9 = 29. This confirms my result.\n\nFINAL: 29"
