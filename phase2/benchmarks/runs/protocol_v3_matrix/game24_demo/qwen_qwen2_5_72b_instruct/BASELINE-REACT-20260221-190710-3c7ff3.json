Since the task is not specified, a common benchmark task for a list of numbers could be to find the sum, average, or perform some other arithmetic operation. Given the available tool 'calc', I can use it to perform calculations. I will start by calculating the sum of the numbers as a default action if no specific task is provided.\n\nACTION: calc sum([2, 2, 4, 9])",

I should try a different approach to calculate the sum using the `calc` tool, perhaps by specifying the operation more clearly.\n\nACTION: calc 2 + 2 + 4 + 9",
