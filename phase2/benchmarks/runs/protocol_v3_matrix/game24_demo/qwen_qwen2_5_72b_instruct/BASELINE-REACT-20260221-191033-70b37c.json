However, without a clear task definition, I cannot proceed further. I need more information to determine the specific goal of the task.\n\nFINAL: The sum of the numbers [5, 5, 7, 10] is 27.

However, if there's another specific operation required (like finding the average, maximum, minimum, etc.), I need that information to proceed accurately.\n\nFINAL: The sum of the numbers [5, 5, 7, 10] is 27.
