However, based on the given input [1, 5, 5, 9] and the available tool `calc`, it seems like we might need to perform some arithmetic operations or calculations with these numbers. Since the specific task is not explicitly stated, I will assume the goal is to find the sum of the elements in the list.\n\nACTION: calc sum([1, 5, 5, 9])",
