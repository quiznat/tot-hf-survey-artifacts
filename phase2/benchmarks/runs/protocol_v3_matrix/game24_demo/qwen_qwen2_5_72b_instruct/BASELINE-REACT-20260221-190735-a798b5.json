However, since no other tools are available, I'll attempt to break down the calculation further into simpler steps.\n\nACTION: calc \"2 + 2\"\nTHINK: By breaking down the calculation into smaller steps, I can avoid the \"unsafe expression\" error and still arrive at the correct answer.

Since the direct method and the step-by-step addition both resulted in an \"unsafe expression\" error, we need to consider if there's a way to safely communicate the calculation or if there's another method to achieve the result without using the calc tool.\n\nTHINK: Given the constraints, and since the calc tool is not accepting even simple arithmetic expressions, I will need to compute the sum manually and provide the final answer directly.\n\nFINAL: 16"
