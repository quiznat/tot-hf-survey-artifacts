Since no specific operation or goal has been mentioned in the task, and the only available tool is 'calc', I will assume that the task requires some kind of numerical computation involving these numbers. A common task could be to find the sum of the numbers. I will proceed with this assumption unless more information is provided.\n\nACTION: calc sum([1, 1, 4, 8])",
