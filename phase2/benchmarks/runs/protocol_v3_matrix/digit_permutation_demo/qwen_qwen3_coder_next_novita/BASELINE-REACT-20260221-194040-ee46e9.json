    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [1, 2, 5, 4] such that the number is divisible by 3. The oracle_max is given as 5421, which is likely the maximum possible number from those digits (5421), but we need to verify if it's divisible by 3. If not, we need to find the next largest permutation that is divisible by 3.\n\nFirst, recall the divisibility rule for 3: a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\nDigits: [1, 2, 5, 4] \u2192 sum = 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 12. Since 12 is divisible by 3, *any* permutation of these digits will be divisible by 3. Therefore, the",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The sum of the digits is 12, which is divisible by 3, so *all* permutations of [1, 2, 5, 4] are divisible by 3. Therefore, the largest possible number formed by these digits \u2014 which is the descending-order arrangement \u2014 is the answer. Sorting digits descending gives 5421, and the oracle_max is 5421, confirming this is the maximum permutation. Since it's divisible by 3 (as all permutations are), the answer is 5421. We can verify with is_divisible to be safe, but logically it's guaranteed. Let's confirm with the tool to align with ReAct protocol.\nACTION: is_divisible 5421\nFINAL: 5421"
