    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 5, 2, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 8325. Let's verify and reason.\n\nA number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Since we don\u2019t have 0, the only possible last digit is 5.\n\nSo the number must end in 5. The remaining digits are [8, 2, 3], and to maximize the number, we should arrange them in descending order before the 5: 8, 3, 2 \u2192 8325.\n\nCheck: 8325 ends in 5 \u2192 divisible by 5. Is it the largest possible? Yes, because any other arrangement of the first three digits would be smaller (e",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The reasoning so far is correct: for divisibility by 5, the number must end in 5 (since 0 is not available). The remaining digits [8, 2, 3] arranged in descending order give 8325, which matches the oracle_max. To confirm correctness, I should verify that 8325 is indeed divisible by 5 using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 8325 5",
