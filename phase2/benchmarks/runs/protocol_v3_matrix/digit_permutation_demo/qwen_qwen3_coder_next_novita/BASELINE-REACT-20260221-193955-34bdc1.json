Since the number must be divisible by 5, its last digit must be 0 or 5. Let's consider possible permutations of the digits in descending order to find the maximum valid number \u2264 9650.\n\nFirst, sort digits descending: [9, 6, 5, 0]. Try forming numbers in descending order and check divisibility by 5 and \u2264 9650.\n\nStart with 9650 (using digits 9,6,5,0). Check:\n- Is 9650 \u2264 9650? Yes.\n- Is 9650 divisible by 5? Yes (",
