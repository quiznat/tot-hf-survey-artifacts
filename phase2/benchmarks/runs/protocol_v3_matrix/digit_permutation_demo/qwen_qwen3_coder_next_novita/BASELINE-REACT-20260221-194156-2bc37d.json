    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 8, 4, 6] that is divisible by 3, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 8664. Let's verify if 8664 is divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Sum of digits of 8664: 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 24, and 24 is divisible by 3 (24 \u00f7 3 = 8). So 8664 is divisible by 3. Also, using the digits [6, 8, 4, 6], the largest possible arrangement is 8664 (since digits sorted descending: 8, 6, 6, 4 \u2192 866",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle says the maximum possible is 8664. We verified that 8664 uses the digits [6, 8, 4, 6] (two 6s, one 8, one 4), and its digit sum is 8+6+6+4 = 24, divisible by 3, so it's divisible by 3. Since 8664 is the largest permutation of those digits (8664 > 8646 > 8466 > ...), and it satisfies divisibility, it must be the answer. We can confirm with the `is_divisible` tool to be thorough, but it's logically sound. Let's verify using the tool to be safe.\nACTION: is_divisible 8664 3",
