    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [3, 1, 6, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle_max is 6312. Since the oracle_max is given as 6312, it's likely the correct answer, but I should verify using the tools. First, I need to check if 6312 is divisible by 4 using the is_divisible tool. If yes, and it's the maximum possible permutation (since 6312 is the largest permutation of those digits \u2014 digits sorted descending: 6,3,2,1 \u2192 6321, but 6312 is less than 6321, so maybe 6321 isn't divisible by 4), I should confirm.\n\nWait: Let's list permutations of [3,1,",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number formed by permuting digits [3,1,6,2] that is divisible by 4. The oracle_max is given as 6312, suggesting it may be the answer, but I must verify using tools. First, recall the divisibility rule for 4: a number is divisible by 4 iff its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. So I should check candidates in descending order of permutations. The largest permutation is 6321, then 6312, then 6231, etc. Let\u2019s test 6312 first using is_divisible, since oracle_max points to it. If divisible, and it's the largest such, that\u2019s the answer. If not, try next largest.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 6312",
