    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible such number is 5360. Let's verify if 5360 is indeed divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 5360, the last two digits are 60, and 60 \u00f7 4 = 15, so yes, 5360 is divisible by 4. Also, 5360 uses digits 5, 3, 6, 0 \u2014 exactly the given digits. So 5360 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's valid, the answer should",
