    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number \u2264 1519 that can be formed using the digits [1, 1, 5, 9] (each used exactly once) and is divisible by 7. We have two tools: `is_divisible(n, d)` to check divisibility, and `best_divisible(digits, divisor, max_val)` which likely returns the largest such number directly. Since `best_divisible` is available and likely optimized for this exact purpose, and the input matches its expected parameters (digits, divisor, max_val), I should call it directly.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [1, 1, 5, 9] 7 1519",
