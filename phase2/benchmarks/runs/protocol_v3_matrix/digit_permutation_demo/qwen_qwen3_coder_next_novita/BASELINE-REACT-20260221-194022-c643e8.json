    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [2, 5, 6, 5] that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6525. Let's verify if 6525 is divisible by 5. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. 6525 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5. Also, 6525 uses digits 6, 5, 2, 5 \u2014 which matches the multiset [2, 5, 6, 5]. So 6525 is a valid candidate. Since the oracle says it's the maximum, and it's divisible by 5, we can confirm it's the answer. Let's double-check using the is_divisible tool to be safe",
