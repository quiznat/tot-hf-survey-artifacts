    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits [3, 0, 6, 0] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 6300. Let's verify if 6300 is achievable and divisible by 6.\n\nDigits of 6300 are [6, 3, 0, 0] \u2014 matches our digits [3, 0, 6, 0] (two zeros, one 3, one 6). So 6300 is constructible.\n\nNow check divisibility by 6: a number divisible by 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n- Divisible by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 6300 ends in 0 \u2192 OK.\n- Divisible by 3: sum of digits",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: A number divisible by 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3. For 6300:  \n- Ends in 0 \u2192 even \u2192 divisible by 2 \u2714\ufe0f  \n- Sum of digits = 6 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 9 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2714\ufe0f  \nSo 6300 is divisible by 6 and uses the digits [3, 0, 6, 0] exactly once. Since the oracle says the maximum is 6300, and we've confirmed it's valid, the answer is 6300. No further checks needed.",
