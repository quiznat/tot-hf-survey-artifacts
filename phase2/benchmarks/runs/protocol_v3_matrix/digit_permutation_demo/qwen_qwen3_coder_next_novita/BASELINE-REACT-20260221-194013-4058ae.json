    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9444. Let's verify if 9444 is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisible by 2? Last digit is 4 \u2192 yes.  \n- Divisible by 3? Sum of digits = 9 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21 \u2192 21 is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes.  \nSo 9444 is divisible by 6. Since the oracle says max is 9444, and it's valid, the answer is 9444. But to follow ReAct, I",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle states the maximum possible is 9444. I verified that 9444 uses the digits [4, 4, 9, 4] exactly once, ends in 4 (so divisible by 2), and digit sum is 21 (divisible by 3), hence divisible by 6. Since it's valid and matches the oracle's maximum, it must be the answer. I can confirm using the is_divisible tool to be thorough.\nACTION: is_divisible 9444 6",
