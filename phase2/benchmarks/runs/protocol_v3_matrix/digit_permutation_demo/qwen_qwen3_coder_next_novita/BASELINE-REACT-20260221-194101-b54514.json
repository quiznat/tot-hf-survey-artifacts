    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [8, 2, 3, 1] that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 8312. Let's verify if 8312 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 8312, the last three digits are 312. 312 \u00f7 8 = 39, which is an integer, so 312 is divisible by 8, hence 8312 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle_max is 8312 and it's divisible by 8, and it's the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending: 8,3,2,1 \u2192 8321,",
