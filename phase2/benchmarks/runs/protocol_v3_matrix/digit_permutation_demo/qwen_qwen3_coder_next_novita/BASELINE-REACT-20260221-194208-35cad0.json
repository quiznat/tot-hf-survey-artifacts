    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 2] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max is given as 9420, which suggests that 9420 is the correct answer (since it's the largest permutation and divisible by 6). Let's verify:  \n- A number is divisible by 6 iff it's divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 0, 2, 4.  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 9+4+0+2 = 15, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 all permutations satisfy this.  \nSo we just need the largest permutation ending in an even digit",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The largest permutation of [9, 4, 0, 2] is 9420. Since the sum of digits is 15 (divisible by 3) and the last digit is 0 (even), 9420 is divisible by both 2 and 3, hence by 6. The oracle_max confirms this is the target. We can directly verify using the is_divisible tool to be thorough.\nACTION: is_divisible 9420 6",
