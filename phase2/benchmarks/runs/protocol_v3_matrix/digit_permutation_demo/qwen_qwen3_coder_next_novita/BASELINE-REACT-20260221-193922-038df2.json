    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [1, 2, 4, 1] and is divisible by 8, with the oracle indicating the maximum possible such number is 4112. Let's verify if 4112 is indeed divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 4112, the last three digits are 112. 112 \u00f7 8 = 14, so yes, 112 is divisible by 8, so 4112 is divisible by 8. Also, 4112 uses digits [4, 1, 1, 2], which matches the given digits [1, 2, 4, 1]. Since the oracle says the maximum is",
