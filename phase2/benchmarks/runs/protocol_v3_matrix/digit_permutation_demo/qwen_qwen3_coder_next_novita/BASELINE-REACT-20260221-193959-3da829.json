    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [8, 5, 2, 3] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and we are told the oracle_max is 8325. Let's verify if 8325 is divisible by 5: numbers divisible by 5 end in 0 or 5. 8325 ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5. Now check if 8325 uses exactly the digits [8, 5, 2, 3]: digits of 8325 are 8, 3, 2, 5 \u2014 yes, same multiset. So 8325 is a valid candidate. Since it's given as oracle_max, it's likely the maximum such number. But to be thorough, we should confirm using tools if needed",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 8325. We verify: (1) digits of 8325 are [8, 3, 2, 5], which match the multiset {8, 5, 2, 3}. (2) 8325 ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5. Since it's the largest possible permutation of those digits ending in 5 (next higher permutations like 8523, 8532, etc., end in 3 or 2 and aren't divisible by 5), and the oracle confirms it's the maximum, we can accept it as the answer without further checks.\nFINAL: 8325"
