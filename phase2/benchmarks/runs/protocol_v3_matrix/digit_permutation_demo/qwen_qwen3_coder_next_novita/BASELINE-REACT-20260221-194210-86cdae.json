    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [9, 3, 7, 2] that is divisible by 4, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9732. Let's verify if 9732 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4. For 9732, the last two digits are 32, and 32 \u00f7 4 = 8, so yes, 9732 is divisible by 4. Since the oracle says 9732 is the maximum, and it's valid, we can check if it's achievable with the given digits: digits of 9732 are 9,7,3,2 \u2014 matches [9,3,7,2]. So 97",
