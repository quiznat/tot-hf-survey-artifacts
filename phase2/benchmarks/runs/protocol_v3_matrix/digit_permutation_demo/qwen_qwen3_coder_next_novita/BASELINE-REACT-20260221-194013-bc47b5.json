    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 8, 1, 6] that is divisible by 8, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 5816. Let's verify if 5816 is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 5816, the last three digits are 816. 816 \u00f7 8 = 102, which is an integer, so 816 is divisible by 8, hence 5816 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle says 5816 is the maximum, and it's divisible by 8, that must be the answer. Let's confirm using the is_divisible tool to be safe.\nACTION: is_div",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The tool name was misremembered. The available tools are 'best_divisible' and 'is_divisible'. I should use 'is_divisible' with the number 5816 and divisor 8 to verify divisibility.\nACTION: is_divisible 5816 8",
