    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the maximum number divisible by 8 that can be formed by rearranging the digits [1, 2, 4, 1]. The oracle_max is given as 4112, which suggests that 4112 is the correct answer (since it's divisible by 8 and uses the digits). Let's verify:  \n- Digits of 4112: 4, 1, 1, 2 \u2014 matches input digits [1,2,4,1].  \n- Check divisibility by 8: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 4112, last three digits = 112. 112 \u00f7 8 = 14 \u2192 divisible.  \nSo 4112 is valid. Since the oracle_max is 4112",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 4112, and we verified that 4112 uses the digits [1,2,4,1] and is divisible by 8 (since 112 \u00f7 8 = 14). To confirm this is indeed the maximum, we should check if any larger permutation of the digits is divisible by 8. The digits sorted descending give 4211, which is the largest possible number. Let's check divisibility of descending permutations using the is_divisible tool to ensure 4112 is maximal.\nACTION: is_divisible 4211",
    "STEP 2 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: 4211 is not divisible by 8. Next, we should check the next largest permutation. After 4211, the next largest arrangement of [1,2,4,1] is 4121. Let's verify its divisibility by 8 using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 4121",
    "STEP 3 OBSERVATION: no",
    "STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: 4121 is not divisible by 8. Next, we check the next largest permutation: 4112 (which matches the oracle_max). Since we already know 4112 is divisible by 8 (112 \u00f7 8 = 14), and it's the next candidate after 4211 and 4121 (both invalid), 4112 must be the maximum valid number. To be thorough, we can confirm using best_divisible to get the maximum directly, but given the oracle and stepwise verification, it's sufficient. However, to follow the ReAct protocol and ensure correctness, let's use best_divisible with the given digits and divisor.\nACTION: best_divisible [1, 2, 4, 1] 8",
