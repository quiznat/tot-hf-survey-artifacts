    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [5, 3, 8, 8] that is divisible by 6, and we are told the oracle_max is 8538. Let's recall: a number is divisible by 6 iff it is divisible by both 2 and 3.  \n- Divisibility by 2: last digit must be even \u2192 possible last digits: 8, 8 (only even digits available are 8s).  \n- Divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. Sum = 5 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 24, which is divisible by 3 \u2192 any permutation will satisfy divisibility by 3.  \nSo we only need to ensure the number ends in 8 (even), and is as large as possible.  \nTo maximize the",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: To maximize the number, we want the largest possible digits in the highest place values, with the constraint that the last digit must be 8 (since only 8s are even). The digits are [5, 3, 8, 8]. To form the largest number ending in 8, we should place the remaining digits [8, 5, 3] in descending order before the final 8. Sorted descending: [8, 5, 3], so candidate = 8538. That matches the oracle_max = 8538. So 8538 is the largest permutation ending in 8, and since digit sum = 24 is divisible by 3, and last digit is 8 (even), it's divisible by 6. Let's verify with the tools to be safe. First, check if 8538 is divisible by 6 using",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: We have reasoned that 8538 is the largest permutation of [5, 3, 8, 8] ending in 8 (ensuring divisibility by 2), and since the digit sum is 24 (divisible by 3), it must be divisible by 6. To confirm, we should use the `is_divisible` tool to verify that 8538 is divisible by 6. If it is, and it matches the oracle_max, then it's the correct answer.
