    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed by permuting the digits [8, 2, 3, 1] and is divisible by 8, with the oracle indicating the maximum possible such number is 8312. I need to verify or find this using the available tools: `best_divisible` and `is_divisible`. Since `oracle_max` is given as 8312, and it's likely the correct answer, I should verify if 8312 is divisible by 8 using `is_divisible`. If it is, then that's the answer. If not, I'd need to use `best_divisible` to find the correct maximum.\n\nLet me first check if 8312 is divisible by 8. The divisibility rule for 8 is that the last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 831",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The divisibility rule for 8 states that a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 8312, the last three digits are 312. Now check if 312 \u00f7 8 = 39 \u2014 yes, exactly. So 312 is divisible by 8, meaning 8312 is divisible by 8. Since the oracle_max is 8312 and it satisfies divisibility, and it's the largest possible permutation (digits sorted descending: 8,3,2,1 \u2192 8321, but 8321 may not be divisible by 8; 8312 is next candidate and works), it's likely the correct answer. I should verify using `is_divisible` to be safe.",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The oracle_max is given as 8312. Using the divisibility rule for 8: a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8. For 8312, the last three digits are 312. Since 312 \u00f7 8 = 39 (exact), 312 is divisible by 8, so 8312 is divisible by 8. To be thorough, I should confirm this using the `is_divisible` tool, as it's available and ensures correctness before concluding.\nACTION: is_divisible 8312 8",
