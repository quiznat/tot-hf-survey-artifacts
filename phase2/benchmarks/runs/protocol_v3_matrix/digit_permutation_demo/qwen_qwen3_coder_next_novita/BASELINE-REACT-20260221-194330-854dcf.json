    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [6, 9, 9, 5] (each used exactly once) that is divisible by 5, and the oracle says the maximum possible is 9965. Let's verify and reason.\n\nA number is divisible by 5 iff its last digit is 0 or 5. The available digits are [6, 9, 9, 5] \u2014 only 5 is a valid last digit for divisibility by 5 (no 0 available). So the number must end in 5.\n\nWe want the largest such number, so we want the remaining digits [6, 9, 9] arranged in descending order: 9, 9, 6 \u2192 9965.\n\nSo 9965 is the largest permutation ending in 5: 9965.\n\nWe should",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: no-action",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The reasoning above shows that the only possible last digit for divisibility by 5 is 5 (since 0 is not available). Arranging the remaining digits [6, 9, 9] in descending order gives 9965, which matches the oracle_max. To confirm correctness, I should verify that 9965 is divisible by 5 using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible 9965 5",
