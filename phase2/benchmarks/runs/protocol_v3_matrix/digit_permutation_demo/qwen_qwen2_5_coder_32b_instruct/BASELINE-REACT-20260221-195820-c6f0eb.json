Since I want the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order first, but then check if that arrangement is divisible by 7. If not, I'll need to try other arrangements.\n\nLet me start by trying the largest possible arrangement: 4432. Then I'll use the is_divisible tool to check if it's divisible by 7. If not, I'll need to try other permutations systematically or use the best_divisible tool which might be more efficient.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 4432 7",

Since I want the largest possible number, I should try arrangements with the highest digits in the leftmost positions, but I also need to ensure divisibility by 7. Let me try the next largest arrangement and work my way down, or use the best_divisible tool which should give me the optimal solution directly.\n\nACTION: best_divisible \"[3, 2, 4, 4]\" 7\nSTEP 2 OBSERVATION: 4432\nSTEP 3 MODEL: THINK: The best_divisible tool returned 4432, but I already checked that this number is not divisible by 7.
