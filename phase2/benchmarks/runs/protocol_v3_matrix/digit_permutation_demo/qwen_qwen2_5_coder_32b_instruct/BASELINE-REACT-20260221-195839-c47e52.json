    "STEP 4 MODEL: STEP 4 MODEL: THINK: The number 8421 is not divisible by 8. I need to find the largest number <= 8421 that is divisible by 8. Since 8421 % 8 = 5 (remainder 5), the largest number <= 8421 that's divisible by 8 would be 8421 - 5 = 8416. However, I need to check if 8416 can be formed using only the digits [2, 4, 8, 1]. \n\nLooking at 8416, it contains digit 6 which is not in our set [2, 4, 8, 1]. So I need to find another approach.\n\nI should try to construct numbers systematically from the largest possible arrangement down until I find one that works and is divisible by 8.\n\nLet me try other arrangements",

    "STEP 5 MODEL: THINK: Let me reconsider this more systematically. I need to find the largest number using digits [2, 4, 8, 1] that is divisible by 8. Since we're looking for the largest possible number, I should start with the largest arrangement (8421) and work downward, checking each possibility.\n\nHowever, since 8421 is not divisible by 8, I need to find the largest valid number that is divisible by 8. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 8, its last three digits must form a number divisible by 8. So I should look at all possible 3-digit endings from my digits [2, 4, 8, 1] and see which ones are divisible by 8.\n\nActually, let me use the best_divisible tool which seems designed for exactly this purpose - finding the best divisible number within constraints.",
