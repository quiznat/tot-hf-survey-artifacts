    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 4, 9, 8] that is divisible by 8. The oracle_max is 9840, so the answer must be less than or equal to 9840.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.\n\nLet me try to construct the largest possible number using all four digits [0, 4, 9, 8] and check if it's divisible by 8, or if I need to rearrange them.\n\nThe largest arrangement would be 9840, but I need to check if this is actually possible with the given digits and divisible by 8.\n\nActually, let me approach this systematically:\n1.
