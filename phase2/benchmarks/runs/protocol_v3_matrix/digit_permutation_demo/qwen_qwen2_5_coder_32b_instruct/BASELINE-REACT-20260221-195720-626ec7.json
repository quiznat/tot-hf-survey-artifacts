    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 3, 6, 6] that is divisible by 4. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what makes a number divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4.\n\nGiven digits: [9, 3, 6, 6]\nTo maximize the number, I want the largest possible arrangement, so I'll try to arrange them in descending order first: 9663\n\nHowever, I need to check if this number is divisible by 4. For 9663, the last two digits are 63. Is 63 divisible by 4? 63 \u00f7 4 = 15.75, so no.\n\nLet me try other arrangements systematically, focusing",
