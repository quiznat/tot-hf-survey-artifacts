Since I'm looking for the maximum value, I should arrange the digits in descending order first, but then check if that arrangement is divisible by 8. If not, I'll need to try other arrangements.\n\nLet me start by trying the largest possible arrangement: 6553. Then I'll check if it's divisible by 8 using the is_divisible tool. If not, I'll need to try other permutations systematically or use the best_divisible tool which might be more efficient.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 6553 8\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The oracle_max is 5536, so I need to find the largest number \u2264 5536 that uses these digits and is divisible by 8.\n\nLet me",
