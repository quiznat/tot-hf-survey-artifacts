    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [3, 1, 5, 6] that is divisible by 7. Since I want the largest number, I should arrange the digits in descending order first (6531) and check if it's divisible by 7. If not, I'll need to try other arrangements.\n\nLet me start by checking if 6531 is divisible by 7 using the is_divisible tool.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 6531 7\n\nWait, I need to be more systematic. The oracle_max is 6531, which means I should look for numbers up to 6531. But I also have the constraint that I must use exactly the digits [3, 1, 5, 6] once each. \n\nLet me reconsider - I should check what the largest possible arrangement is first",
