    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [0, 9, 2, 3] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max of 9023 suggests this is the upper limit for consideration.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 0, 9, 2, 3. I can arrange them in different orders to create various numbers.\n\nSince I want the largest possible number that's divisible by 7, I should try to form the largest possible numbers first and check if they're divisible by 7.\n\nThe largest possible arrangement would be 9320 (using all digits in descending order). However, I need to check if it's divisible by 7.\n\nLet me start by checking if 9320 is divisible by 7 using the is_divisible tool.\nACTION: is_divisible",

The next largest arrangements would be:\n- 9302\n- 9230\n- 9203\n- 9032\n- 9023\n\nLet me check 9230 next.\nACTION: is_divisible 9230\nSTEP",
