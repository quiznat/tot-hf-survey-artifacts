    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [1, 2, 4, 1] that is divisible by 8. Since I'm looking for the maximum value, I should arrange the digits in descending order first, but then check if that arrangement is divisible by 8. If not, I'll need to try other arrangements.\n\nLet me first try the largest possible arrangement: 4211. Then I'll check if it's divisible by 8. If not, I'll need to try other permutations systematically or use the available tools.\n\nLooking at the tools available:\n- best_divisible: This might help find the best divisible number\n- is_divisible: This can check if a specific number is divisible by 8\n\nSince I want the maximum number, let me start with the largest permutation and work my way down, or use the best_divisible tool which seems most appropriate.",
