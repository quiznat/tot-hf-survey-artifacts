    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [9, 4, 0, 2] that is divisible by 6. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value I should consider is 9420.\n\nFirst, let me understand what makes a number divisible by 6:\n1. It must be divisible by 2 (even number)\n2. It must be divisible by 3 (sum of digits divisible by 3)\n\nLet me check if I can form any valid numbers and then use the tools to verify divisibility.\n\nTo maximize the number, I should arrange the digits in descending order: 9420\nBut I also need to ensure it's divisible by 6.\n\nLet me first check if 9420 itself works:\n- Is it even? Yes, ends in 0\n- Sum of digits: 9 + 4 + 2 +",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: Let me continue my analysis. I need to check if 9420 is divisible by 6.\n\nFor 9420:\n- It's even (ends in 0), so divisible by 2 \u2713\n- Sum of digits: 9 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 15\n- 15 is divisible by 3, so 9420 is divisible by 3 \u2713\n\nSince 9420 is divisible by both 2 and 3, it's divisible by 6.\n\nHowever, I should also check if there might be a larger valid number that's less than or equal to 9420, but since 9420 uses all available digits and is already the largest possible arrangement, this should be optimal.\n\nLet me verify with the tools to make sure.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 9420 6",
