    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: I need to find the largest number that can be formed using the digits [5, 6, 0, 7] that is divisible by 7. The oracle_max constraint tells me the maximum value is 7560, so I should look for numbers up to that limit.\n\nFirst, let me understand what numbers I can form with these digits. I have four digits: 5, 6, 0, 7. I can arrange them in different orders to create various numbers.\n\nSince I want the largest possible number that's divisible by 7 and doesn't exceed 7560, I should start by trying arrangements that form large numbers first.\n\nLet me try to use the best_divisible tool to help me find this number systematically.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [5, 6, 0, 7], \"divisor\": 7, \"max_value\": 7",

However, I need to check if this is divisible by 7 and within the limit of 7560.\n\nSince 7650 > 7560, it exceeds the maximum allowed value, so I need to find the next largest valid number.\n\nLet me analyze what the tool response will tell me about the best divisible number.",
