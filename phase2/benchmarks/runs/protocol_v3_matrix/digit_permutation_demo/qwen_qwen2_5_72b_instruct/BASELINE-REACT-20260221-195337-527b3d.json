    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to involve checking if any combination of the provided digits can form a number that is divisible by the given divisor (8 in this case). The `is_divisible` tool can be used to check divisibility, but we need to generate numbers from the digits first. Since the maximum value to consider is 4128, we should start generating and testing numbers from the smallest possible to this limit.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [2, 4, 8, 1], \"max_value\": 4128}",

However, I need to ensure this number is indeed divisible by 8 using the `is_divisible` tool to confirm it meets the criteria.\n\nACTION: is_divisible {\"number\": 4128, \"divisor\": 8}",
