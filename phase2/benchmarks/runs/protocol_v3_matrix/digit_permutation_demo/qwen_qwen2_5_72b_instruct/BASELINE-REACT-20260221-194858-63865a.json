    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number that can be formed from the digits provided, which is also divisible by the given divisor (8 in this case). We have two available tools: `best_divisible` and `is_divisible`. Before diving into using these tools, I need to understand what they do. Typically, `is_divisible` would check if a number is divisible by another, and `best_divisible` might find the best number that meets certain criteria. However, since we don't have specific documentation on these tools, I will start by generating possible numbers from the digits and then use `is_divisible` to check if they are divisible by 8. If not, I'll use `best_divisible` to find the best possible number.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {'digits': [1, 2, 4, 1], 'divisor': 8}",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 4112",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: FINAL: 4112\n\nThe `best_divisible` tool has returned the number 4112, which is the largest number formed from the digits [1, 2, 4, 1] that is divisible by 8. Therefore, the answer to the task is 4112."
