    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is not clearly stated in the input provided, but given the tools and inputs, it seems like the goal is to find the largest number formed by the digits that is divisible by the given divisor (7 in this case) and does not exceed the `oracle_max` value (4319). I will start by generating potential numbers from the digits and checking their divisibility.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [4, 3, 9, 1], \"divisor\": 7, \"max_value\": 4319}",
