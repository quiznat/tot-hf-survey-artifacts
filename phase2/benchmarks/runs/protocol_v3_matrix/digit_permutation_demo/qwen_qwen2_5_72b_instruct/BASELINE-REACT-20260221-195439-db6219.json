    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task seems to be about finding the largest number from the given digits that is divisible by the provided divisor (7). The `oracle_max` value might serve as an upper limit or a reference point for the solution. I should start by checking if any permutation of the digits forms a number that is divisible by 7 and is as close as possible to `oracle_max`.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [4, 2, 0, 8], \"divisor\": 7, \"oracle_max\": 8204}",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function has returned the number 8204, which is formed by the digits [4, 2, 0, 8] and is divisible by 7. Since this number is also within the `oracle_max` limit, it appears to be the correct answer.\n\nFINAL: 8204"
