    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: To solve this problem, I need to find the largest number that can be formed from the given digits which is also divisible by the given divisor (7 in this case). The number should not exceed the oracle_max value (5488). I will start by checking if any permutation of the digits forms a number that is divisible by 7 and does not exceed 5488.\n\nACTION: best_divisible {\"digits\": [5, 8, 8, 4], \"divisor\": 7, \"oracle_max\": 5488}",
    "STEP 1 OBSERVATION: 5488",
    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `best_divisible` function has returned 5488, which means the largest number that can be formed from the digits [5, 8, 8, 4] and is divisible by 7, without exceeding the `oracle_max` value of 5488, is indeed 5488. Since 5488 is within the limit and satisfies the divisibility condition, it is the correct answer.\n\nFINAL: 5488"
