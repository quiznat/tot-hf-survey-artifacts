    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is not clearly defined in the prompt, but based on the inputs and available tools, it seems like the goal is to find a number (or numbers) from the 'digits' list that can form a number divisible by 'divisor' and that is also less than or equal to 'oracle_max'. To start, I will use the `is_divisible` tool to check if any single digit from the 'digits' list is already divisible by 'divisor'.\n\nACTION: is_divisible 7 6",

Next, I should consider combinations of these digits to form a number that could be divisible by 6. Since forming all possible combinations manually would be inefficient, I will use the `best_divisible` tool to find the best combination that meets the criteria.\n\nACTION: best_divisible [7, 2, 4, 5] 6 7542\nSTEP 5 OBSERVATION: 54\nTHINK: The `best_divisible` tool has returned 54, which is a number formed from the given digits and is divisible by 6.
