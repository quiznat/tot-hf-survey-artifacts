    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task is to solve a benchmark task using a ReAct loop. The input is [1, 1, 2, 7], and the only available tool is `calc`. Since no specific goal is given (e.g., compute a result, find a pattern, or solve an equation), I need to infer the likely intent. Common benchmark tasks with number lists involve computing a mathematical expression (e.g., sum, product, or using operations to reach a target like 24).
