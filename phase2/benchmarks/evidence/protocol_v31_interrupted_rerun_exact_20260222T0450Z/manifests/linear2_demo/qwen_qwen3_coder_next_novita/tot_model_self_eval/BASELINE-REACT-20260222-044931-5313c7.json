    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input provides two equations in the form of coefficient arrays: [[-8, -1, 33], [-8, -7, -9]]. Assuming these represent linear equations in two variables (x and y), each array likely corresponds to an equation of the form: a*x + b*y = c. So:\n\nEquation 1: -8x - y = 33  \nEquation 2: -8x -7y = -9  \n\nWe need to solve this system for x and y. Let's analyze.\n\nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 (or vice versa) to eliminate x:\n\nEq1: -8x - y = 33  \nEq2: -8x -7y = -9  \n\nSubtract Eq2 from Eq1:  \n(-8x - y) - (-8x -7y) = 33 - (-9)  \n\u2192",

Let's verify with Eq2:  \n-8*(-5) -7*7 = 40 - 49 = -9 \u2714\ufe0f matches RHS.  \n\nNow, since the task provides tools `check_xy` and `solve2`, and we have a candidate solution (x=-5, y=7), we should verify",

    "STEP 3 MODEL: THINK: We have derived the solution x = -5, y = 7 by solving the system manually and verified it satisfies both equations. To complete the benchmark task, we should use the available tools to confirm the solution. The `check_xy` tool is appropriate for verifying a candidate (x, y) against the given equations. We'll call `check_xy` with x = -5 and y = 7.\nACTION: check_xy -5 7",
