    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations.

Let me reconsider: the equations are -x + 2y = -15 and 3x - 5y = 41. I can solve manually using elimination or substitution. Multiply the first equation by 3: -3x + 6y = -45. Add to the second equation: (-3x + 6y) + (3x - 5y) = -45 + 41 \u2192 y = -4. Substitute y = -4 into first equation: -x + 2(-4) = -15 \u2192 -x - 8 = -15 \u2192 -x = -7 \u2192 x = 7. So solution is x=7, y=-4. Now I should verify using `check_xy` to be safe. The tool likely",
