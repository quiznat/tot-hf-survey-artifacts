    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task input contains a list of equations in the form [a, b, c], representing equations like ax + by = c. We have two equations:  \n1. -4x + 8y = -56  \n2. 9x + 9y = 45  \n\nWe need to solve for x and y. The available tools are `check_xy` (likely to verify a candidate solution) and `solve2` (likely to solve a 2-variable linear system). Since we have exactly two equations and two unknowns, `solve2` is appropriate. Let's use `solve2` with the equations provided.\n\nTool input format for `solve2` is likely the list of equations: [[-4, 8, -56], [9, 9, 45]].\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-4, 8, -56], [9, 9",

    "STEP 2 MODEL: THINK: The `solve2` tool successfully solved the system of equations and returned x = 8.0 and y = -3.0. Let's verify this solution using the `check_xy` tool to ensure correctness. We'll plug x = 8 and y = -3 into both original equations:\n\n1. -4x + 8y = -4(8) + 8(-3) = -32 - 24 = -56 \u2714\ufe0f  \n2. 9x + 9y = 9(8) + 9(-3) = 72 - 27 = 45 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct. However, since `solve2` already gave us the solution and the verification is consistent, we can now provide the final answer.\n\nFINAL: x=8.0,y=-3.0"
