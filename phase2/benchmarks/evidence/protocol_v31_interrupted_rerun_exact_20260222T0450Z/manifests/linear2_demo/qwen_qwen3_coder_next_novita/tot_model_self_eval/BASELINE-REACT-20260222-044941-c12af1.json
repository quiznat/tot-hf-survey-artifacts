    "STEP 1 MODEL: THINK: The task involves solving a system of two linear equations. The input provides coefficients in the format [[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2]], representing equations:  \n-5x - 7y = -16  \n-9x + 8y = -70  \n\nI need to find values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I can use the `solve2` tool, which likely solves a 2x2 linear system given coefficients. Let me try that.\n\nACTION: solve2 [[-5, -7, -16], [-9, 8, -70]]",
