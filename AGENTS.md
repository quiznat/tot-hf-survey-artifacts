# AGENTS.md

Project working guide for Codex and collaborators.

## Purpose
This repo is a long-term two-track effort:
1. Publish a high-quality Hugging Face blog article adapted from the current manuscript.
2. Build a rigorous original research project (and paper) based on the same theme.

## Session Startup Checklist
At the start of every session:
1. Read `PROJECT_STATE.md` first.
2. Read `ROADMAP.md` second.
3. Read `TASK_BACKLOG.md` for actionable items.
4. Continue from the highest-priority `in_progress` or `next` item.

## Session Exit Checklist
Before ending a session:
1. Update `PROJECT_STATE.md`:
   - current status
   - what changed
   - next concrete step
   - blockers
2. Append a short entry to `SESSION_LOG.md`.
3. Update task statuses in `TASK_BACKLOG.md`.
4. If strategy changed, add a note in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Collaboration Rules
1. Prefer small, reviewable commits.
2. Do not present illustrative metrics as measured results.
3. Mark pseudo-code clearly as pseudo-code.
4. Flag uncertain claims for verification before publication.
5. Keep references accurate and typo-free.

## Quality Bar
For blog-ready writing:
1. Clear target audience.
2. Factual accuracy and source links.
3. Practical examples that run or are explicitly non-runnable.

For research-ready writing:
1. Reproducible protocol.
2. Explicit baselines and ablations.
3. Measured results (not placeholders).
