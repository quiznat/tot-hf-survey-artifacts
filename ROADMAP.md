# ROADMAP

## Track 1: Hugging Face Blog Publication

### Goal
Convert the current manuscript into a concise, accurate, practical blog post suitable for the Hugging Face blog audience.

### Milestones
1. Positioning and scope
   - Define audience (practitioners vs researchers).
   - Define post length and structure.
2. Content rewrite
   - Remove overclaims.
   - Keep practical architecture and implementation guidance.
   - Replace weak claims with sourced, scoped statements.
3. Technical validation
   - Verify API/library usage against current docs.
   - Ensure code snippets are coherent.
4. Editorial polish
   - Tight intro, actionable body, clear takeaway.
   - Reference links and copy edit pass.
5. Publish package
   - Final markdown draft.
   - Suggested title/subtitle options.
   - Short social summary text.

### Definition of Done (Track 1)
1. Blog draft is internally consistent and claim-safe.
2. No citation or naming errors.
3. Ready for submission with minimal edits.

## Track 2: Original Research Project

### Goal
Produce a credible, reproducible research artifact on ToT-enhanced agent behavior.

### Milestones
1. Research question and hypothesis
   - Choose one narrow, testable claim.
2. Experimental design
   - Task suite, baselines, metrics, compute budget.
3. Implementation
   - Reproducible code path, config files, logging.
4. Evaluation
   - Main results + ablations + error analysis.
5. Paper drafting
   - Methods, experiments, limitations, ethics.
6. Release package
   - Code, configs, data instructions, reproducibility appendix.

### Definition of Done (Track 2)
1. Claims are backed by measured experiments.
2. Another person can reproduce core results from instructions.
3. Paper is category-appropriate for arXiv submission.
