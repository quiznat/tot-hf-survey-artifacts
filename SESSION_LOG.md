# SESSION_LOG

## 2026-02-19

- Created long-term project scaffolding:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `TASK_BACKLOG.md`
  - `DECISIONS.md`
  - `SESSION_LOG.md`
- Set initial focus to Track 1.
- Next step was claim-safe structural rewrite.

## 2026-02-19 (later)

- Split source manuscript into two new drafts:
  - `drafts/tot_hf_agents_survey.md` (claim-safe survey overview)
  - `drafts/tot_hf_agents_novel_work_spec.md` (empirical research spec)
- Updated state, backlog, and decisions to reflect split progress.
- Next step: harden survey framing and evidence boundaries.

## 2026-02-19 (HTML edit pass)

- Edited `/Users/quiznat/Desktop/Tree_of_Thought/Tree of Thoughts Meets Hugging Face Agents — ClaudDib.html` directly.
- Added survey framing and explicit claim boundaries section.
- Added code-labeling and pseudo-code notices.
- Softened overclaims in abstract/contributions/conclusion.
- Fixed reference typo `ichter` -> `Ichter`.

## 2026-02-19 (scholarly-standard pivot)

- Strategic direction updated: Track 1 is now scholarly survey publication standard (not blog-first).
- Rewrote Appendix C as source-attributed benchmark evidence with explicit evidence boundary note.
- Added independent follow-up citation (ICML 2025 Fleet of Agents) to references.
- Replaced unsourced numeric comparative table with qualitative, non-benchmark analysis.
- Marked Section 4 case studies as synthetic walkthroughs.
- Added planning artifacts:
  - `SCHOLARLY_SURVEY_STANDARD.md`
  - `SURVEY_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- Updated:
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `TASK_BACKLOG.md`
  - `PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `DECISIONS.md`

## 2026-02-19 (Track 1 progression)

- Added formal survey-methodology content directly in the HTML manuscript:
  - research questions
  - search/source protocol
  - inclusion/exclusion criteria
  - extraction and evidence-level schema
- Added publication artifacts to manuscript appendices:
  - Appendix D: Study selection flow scaffold
  - Appendix E: Core study extraction matrix
- Added methodology references (PRISMA + software-engineering evidence-synthesis sources) to Section 8.
- Updated `TASK_BACKLOG.md` and `PROJECT_STATE.md` to reflect in-progress state for frozen-search completion and full extraction expansion.

## 2026-02-19 (Track 1 Gate 1 complete)

- Completed frozen core-corpus selection run in manuscript:
  - Run ID: `TOT-HF-SURVEY-2026-02-19`
  - Fixed PRISMA-style counts inserted in Appendix D
  - Full-text exclusion ledger with reasons inserted in Appendix D
- Added standalone reproducibility artifact:
  - `SURVEY_SELECTION_LEDGER.md`
- Updated tracking docs:
  - `TASK_BACKLOG.md` (`T1-03` marked done)
  - `PROJECT_STATE.md` (Gate 1 completion reflected)

## 2026-02-19 (Track 1 Gate 2 complete)

- Expanded Appendix E from grouped rows to full row-level extraction matrix.
- Coverage now includes all 22 included records from frozen run `TOT-HF-SURVEY-2026-02-19`.
- Updated tracking docs:
  - `TASK_BACKLOG.md` (`T1-04` marked done; `T1-01/T1-02/T1-07` marked done)
  - `PROJECT_STATE.md` (next action moved to citation audit + API validation)
  - `SURVEY_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` (resolved methodology/selection/extraction gaps removed)

## 2026-02-19 (Track 1 Gate 3 pass 1)

- Performed first-pass claim/citation hardening on key factual sections:
  - Sections 1-3 (intro, theory, HF ecosystem)
  - Section 6.5 threats-to-validity
  - Appendix C evidence-boundary statements
- Added inline citations where missing and softened unsupported quantitative language.
- Fixed malformed Unit 5 list item in Section 3.2.1.
- Remaining work: full manuscript line-by-line citation sweep and API-validity check.
