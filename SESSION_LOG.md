# SESSION_LOG

## 2026-02-19

- Created long-term project scaffolding:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `TASK_BACKLOG.md`
  - `DECISIONS.md`
  - `SESSION_LOG.md`
- Set initial focus to Track 1.
- Next step was claim-safe structural rewrite.

## 2026-02-19 (later)

- Split source manuscript into two new drafts:
  - `drafts/tot_hf_agents_survey.md` (claim-safe survey overview)
  - `drafts/tot_hf_agents_novel_work_spec.md` (empirical research spec)
- Updated state, backlog, and decisions to reflect split progress.
- Next step: harden survey framing and evidence boundaries.

## 2026-02-19 (HTML edit pass)

- Added survey framing and explicit claim boundaries section.

- Added independent follow-up citation (ICML 2025 Fleet of Agents) to references.
- Replaced unsourced numeric comparative table with qualitative, non-benchmark analysis.
- Marked Section 4 case studies as synthetic walkthroughs.

  - `SCHOLARLY_SURVEY_STANDARD.md`
  - `SURVEY_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- Updated:
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `TASK_BACKLOG.md`
  - `PROJECT_STATE.md`
  - `DECISIONS.md`
