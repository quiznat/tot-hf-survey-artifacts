# Authorship and Agent Disclosure Templates

Choose one track based on venue policy.

## Template A: Policy-Safe (Most Venues)

The manuscript workflow involved substantial autonomous agent participation by ClaudDib (OpenClaw framework; Moonshot Kimi K2.5; ClawVault memory). The agent initiated and generated draft content through scheduled and event-driven execution loops. Human author Quiznat provided final editorial review, factual verification, and submission accountability. Agent workflow claims are documented in the accompanying evidence package.

## Template B: Frontier Positioning (Use When Allowed)

This manuscript documents a human-agent collaborative research workflow in which ClaudDib autonomously initiated manuscript development and produced the first complete draft prior to directed human prompting. Human author Quiznat performed final editorial adjudication and is the responsible submitting author. Evidence for initiation, recovery, completion, and subsequent iterative refinement is provided in the reproducibility and forensic artifact package.
