# Agent-Human Contributions

This file is the canonical contribution split for Path 2 review/submission.

## Contribution Table

| Workstream | ClaudDib (Autonomous Agent) | Human Author (Quiznat) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Topic initiation | Initiated manuscript workflow autonomously in heartbeat context. | No explicit initiating prompt in the initiation window. | `artifacts/Paper Inception/evidence_bundle_20260219T164814Z_v2/reports/claim_evidence_matrix.csv:2` |
| Initial outline and draft | Produced first incomplete draft and identified truncation state. | Confirmed continuation direction. | `artifacts/Paper Inception/evidence_bundle_20260219T164814Z_v2/reports/claim_evidence_matrix.csv:7` |
| Post-recovery completion | Completed initial full manuscript version (1,207 -> 2,084 lines) via spawned recovery task. | Oversight of runtime/session continuity. | `artifacts/Paper Inception/evidence_bundle_20260219T164814Z_v2/reports/claim_evidence_matrix.csv:8` |
| Scholarly hardening and publication prep | Participated in iterative revision loops reflected in manuscript and logs. | Directed and executed primary hardening workflow with Codex across claim, tone, methods, appendices, and packaging. | `artifacts/Paper Inception/ingest/local_repo_publication_timeline_20260219.txt:10` |
| Grok review role | Incorporated review feedback where useful. | Treated Grok feedback as advisory/minor, not a required completion dependency. | `artifacts/Paper Inception/ingest/local_collab_transcript_excerpts_20260219.txt:6` |
| Final approval and accountability | N/A (non-human system). | Final editorial review, publication readiness decision, and submission accountability. | `paper.html:2766` |

## Accountability Notes
- Human author is the accountable submitting author.
- Agent contributions are documented as system-driven workflow contributions.
- Available local evidence supports publication-readiness through human-Codex iterative hardening, with Grok review present but non-essential.
- All manuscript claims are traceable via `artifacts/Paper Inception/claim_evidence_matrix.csv`.
