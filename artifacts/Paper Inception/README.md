# Path 2 / Part 2 / Plan 2 Scaffold

This folder is the working scaffold for the peer-review compliant track while preserving the autonomous-agent initiative claims.

## Goal
- Bind each major authorship/autonomy claim to verifiable artifacts.
- Keep manuscript language aligned with evidence strength.
- Produce a submission-ready disclosure/contributions package.

## Gate Model
- `Gate 1`: Forensic collection complete and hash-locked.
- `Gate 2`: Claim-evidence matrix filled (no unsupported hard claims).
- `Gate 3`: Manuscript wording aligned to evidence levels.
- `Gate 4`: Submission package complete (disclosure, contributions, checklist).

## Files
- [`forensics_ingest_checklist.md`](forensics_ingest_checklist.md)
- [`claim_evidence_matrix.csv`](claim_evidence_matrix.csv)
- [`agent_human_contributions.md`](agent_human_contributions.md)
- [`authorship_disclosure_template.md`](authorship_disclosure_template.md)
- [`submission_readiness_checklist.md`](submission_readiness_checklist.md)
- [`open_items.md`](open_items.md)

## How to use this scaffold
1. Drop the VM forensic bundle path and manifest into `forensics_ingest_checklist.md`.
2. Fill `claim_evidence_matrix.csv` first, before changing manuscript claims.
3. Update `agent_human_contributions.md` from logs and git history.
4. Select and adapt disclosure text in `authorship_disclosure_template.md`.
5. Clear all blockers in `submission_readiness_checklist.md`.
