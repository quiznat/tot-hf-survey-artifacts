# Ingest Directory

This directory is the controlled intake location for additional forensic bundles.

## Folder Convention
Use UTC timestamped directories, for example:
- `artifacts/publication-evidence/ingest/2026-02-19T210000Z/`

## Expected Bundle Subdirectories
- `raw_logs/`
- `configs/`
- `timelines/`
- `manifests/`
- `reports/`
- `screenshots/`

## Required Follow-Up
After ingest, update:
- `../forensics-ingest-checklist.md`
- `../claim-evidence-matrix.csv`
