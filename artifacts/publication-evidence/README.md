# Publication Evidence Package

This directory provides the evidence framework used to validate high-stakes manuscript claims and submission readiness.

## Purpose
- Map manuscript claims to explicit supporting artifacts.
- Maintain conservative claim language aligned with available evidence.
- Provide auditable authorship/disclosure and readiness documentation.

## Evidence Gates
- `Gate 1`: Forensic collection complete and manifest-locked.
- `Gate 2`: Claim-evidence matrix complete with no unsupported high-stakes claims.
- `Gate 3`: Manuscript wording aligned to evidence levels.
- `Gate 4`: Submission package complete and externally review-ready.
