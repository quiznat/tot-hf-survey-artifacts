# Local Publication Readiness Validation

Date: 19 February 2026  
Scope: local workspace evidence and collaboration transcript excerpts.

## Finding 1: Publication hardening occurred through sustained local revision

Evidence:
- `story/publication-evidence/ingest/local-repo-publication-timeline-20260219.txt:5`
- `story/publication-evidence/ingest/local-repo-publication-timeline-20260219.txt:10`
- `story/publication-evidence/ingest/local-repo-publication-timeline-20260219.txt:14`
- `story/publication-evidence/ingest/local-repo-publication-timeline-20260219.txt:15`
- `story/publication-evidence/ingest/local-repo-publication-timeline-20260219.txt:22`

Interpretation:
- The commit timeline shows sequential work on survey framing, claim calibration, appendices, and publication packaging.
- The readiness state is supported by iterative revisions rather than a single generation event.

## Finding 2: Grok feedback is present but non-blocking

Evidence:
- `story/publication-evidence/ingest/local-collab-transcript-excerpts-20260219.txt:6`

Interpretation:
- A Codex + Grok review loop is documented.
- The revision timeline demonstrates readiness without requiring Grok-specific dependencies.

## Finding 3: Manuscript state matches pre-submission intent

Evidence:
- `paper.html:2755`
- `paper.html:2766`
- `paper.html:2788`
- `paper.html:2793`

Interpretation:
- Revision history, authorship framing, explicit versioning, and LLM-review reference are present in the canonical manuscript.

## Finding 4: Public distribution and reproducibility workflows are operational

Evidence:
- `story/publication-evidence/ingest/local-repo-publication-timeline-20260219.txt:14`
- `story/publication-evidence/ingest/local-repo-publication-timeline-20260219.txt:36`
- `story/publication-evidence/ingest/local-repo-publication-timeline-20260219.txt:38`

Interpretation:
- GitHub Pages and arXiv artifact workflows were implemented and validated during the hardening sequence.

## Verdict

Local evidence supports the claim that publication-readiness was achieved through human-agent iterative hardening with documented traceability.
