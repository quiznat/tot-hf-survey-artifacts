# Authorship and Agent Disclosure Templates

These templates support venue-specific disclosure compliance while preserving evidence-backed wording.

## Template A: Policy-Conservative

The manuscript workflow included substantial autonomous agent participation by ClaudDib (OpenClaw framework, Moonshot Kimi K2.5, ClawVault memory). The agent initiated manuscript activity and generated draft material through scheduled and event-driven execution loops. Human author Michael Leydon conducted editorial review, factual adjudication, and submission accountability. Supporting workflow evidence is provided in the accompanying reproducibility package.

## Template B: Frontier Positioning (Use Only If Venue Policy Permits)

This manuscript reports a human-agent collaborative workflow in which ClaudDib autonomously initiated manuscript development and produced the first complete draft before directed human prompting. Human author Michael Leydon performed final editorial adjudication and is the responsible submitting author. Evidence for initiation, recovery, completion, and iterative refinement is provided in the associated evidence package.
