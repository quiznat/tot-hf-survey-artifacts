# Story Notes

This folder stores project narrative and provenance material that is intentionally kept out of the scholarly manuscript.

Scope examples:
- origin and workflow timeline notes,
- operational/forensic logs and validation bundles,
- public build-in-the-open context that is not required for survey claims.

The manuscript remains focused on citable technical evidence and survey methodology.
