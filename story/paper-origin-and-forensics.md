# Paper Origin and Forensics (Non-Manuscript Narrative)

This note captures provenance and publication-readiness artifacts that are useful for project history but are not part of the scholarly survey paper.

## Evidence Layers
- Frozen forensic bundle (server scope): `artifacts/publication-evidence/evidence_bundle_20260219T164814Z_v2/`
- Local publication-readiness validation (local + collaboration scope): `artifacts/publication-evidence/local-publication-readiness-validation.md`

## Purpose
- Preserve project origin and workflow context.
- Keep narrative/process evidence available for future public documentation.
- Separate story/provenance material from the manuscript's technical claims and citations.
