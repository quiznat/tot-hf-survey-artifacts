**Subtitle:** A Survey of Tree of Thoughts and Hugging Face Agent Frameworks

This repository hosts the canonical manuscript, submission derivatives, and reproducibility materials for a scholarly survey of Tree of Thoughts (ToT) reasoning and Hugging Face agent frameworks.

## Canonical Manuscript (HTML)
- [https://quiznat.github.io/tot-hf-survey-artifacts/paper.html](https://quiznat.github.io/tot-hf-survey-artifacts/paper.html)

## Phase 2 Rendered Draft (HTML)
- [https://quiznat.github.io/tot-hf-survey-artifacts/phase2/paper.html](https://quiznat.github.io/tot-hf-survey-artifacts/phase2/paper.html)

## Rendered PDF
- [`paper.pdf`](paper.pdf) (generated by CI from `submission/arxiv/main.tex`)

## Version and Status
- Version: `v1.1.1 – Pre-submission corrections (21 February 2026)`
- Status: `submission preparation`
- Revision history: [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)

## Scope
- Systematic survey of ToT reasoning methods and agent framework design patterns.
- Comparative synthesis of architecture, orchestration, evaluation, and reproducibility practices.
- Explicit separation of evidence-backed claims from illustrative examples and pseudo-code.

## Reproducibility Anchor
- Frozen protocol run ID: `TOT-HF-SURVEY-2026-02-19`
- Artifact index: [`artifacts/`](artifacts/)
- Screening log: [`artifacts/screening-log.md`](artifacts/screening-log.md)
- Project narrative and provenance (non-manuscript): [`story/`](story/)

## Build and Release Workflows
- `.github/workflows/publish-site.yml`: publishes `paper.html`, generates and publishes `phase2/paper.html` from `phase2/manuscript/PREPAPER.md`, and deploys `assets/` to GitHub Pages.
- `.github/workflows/build-arxiv-artifacts.yml`: generates `main.tex`, compiles `main.pdf`, regenerates `tot-hf-agents-llm.md`, and publishes `arxiv-bundle.tgz` as a workflow artifact.
- `.github/workflows/build-tmlr-submission.yml`: generates an anonymous TMLR package and compiles an official-style anonymous PDF using the current `tmlr.sty`.

## Repository Structure
- `paper.html`: canonical manuscript source.
- `paper.pdf`: CI-published rendered PDF.
- `tot-hf-agents-llm.md`: machine-readable manuscript derivative.
- `assets/`: figures and static assets used in the manuscript.
- `artifacts/`: manuscript-facing reproducibility artifacts.
- `story/`: project narrative, provenance notes, and forensic evidence package.
- `submission/`: export scripts and submission-focused conversion assets.
  - Includes a TMLR path in `submission/tmlr/`.
- `examples/paper_snippets/`: runnable, tested sample code mapped to runnable manuscript snippets.
- `tests/test_paper_snippets.py`: unit checks for runnable snippet examples and shell/docker sample validation.
- `phase2/`: novel contribution workspace (ToT-HF implementation roadmap, project state, reproducibility templates, and benchmark planning).
  - Rendered draft source: `phase2/manuscript/PREPAPER.md`
  - Render script: `phase2/manuscript/build_phase2_html.sh`

## Snippet Validation
- Run runnable-snippet checks:
  - `python3 -m unittest tests/test_paper_snippets.py`
