## Scope
- Systematic survey of ToT reasoning methods and agent framework design patterns.
- Comparative synthesis of architecture, orchestration, evaluation, and reproducibility practices.
- Explicit separation of evidence-backed claims from illustrative examples and pseudo-code.

## Reproducibility Anchor
- Frozen protocol run ID: `TOT-HF-SURVEY-2026-02-19`
- Artifact index: [`artifacts/`](artifacts/)
- Publication evidence package: [`artifacts/publication-evidence/`](artifacts/publication-evidence/)

## Build and Release Workflows
- `.github/workflows/publish-site.yml`: publishes `paper.html` and `assets/` to GitHub Pages.
- `.github/workflows/build-arxiv-artifacts.yml`: generates `main.tex`, compiles `main.pdf`, regenerates `tot-hf-agents-llm.md`, and publishes `arxiv-bundle.tgz` as a workflow artifact.
- `.github/workflows/build-tmlr-submission.yml`: generates an anonymous TMLR package and compiles an official-style anonymous PDF using the current `tmlr.sty`.

## Repository Structure
- `paper.html`: canonical manuscript source.
- `paper.pdf`: CI-published rendered PDF.
- `tot-hf-agents-llm.md`: machine-readable manuscript derivative.
- `assets/`: figures and static assets used in the manuscript.
- `artifacts/`: reproducibility documentation and evidence package.
- `submission/`: export scripts and submission-focused conversion assets.
  - Includes a TMLR path in `submission/tmlr/`.
- `phase2/`: novel contribution workspace (ToT-HF implementation roadmap, project state, reproducibility templates, and benchmark planning).
