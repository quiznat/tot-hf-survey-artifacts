## Current Focus
Track 1 (scholarly survey publication standard).

## Current Status
Split architecture completed:
1. Survey draft created.
2. Novel-work research spec created.
3. HTML manuscript received a framing/clarity edit pass (survey scope, claim boundaries, pseudo-code labeling, and citation typo fixes).
4. Appendix C rewritten to report source-attributed benchmark evidence only, with explicit evidence boundaries.
5. Unsourced quantitative comparative table removed and replaced with qualitative non-benchmark analysis.
6. Survey methodology section added (RQs, search strategy, inclusion/exclusion, extraction protocol).
7. Appendix D/E added as publication artifacts (selection-flow counts + exclusion ledger + row-level extraction matrix).
8. Frozen core-corpus selection run completed with fixed counts and exclusion ledger (`TOT-HF-SURVEY-2026-02-19`).
9. Appendix E expanded to full row-level extraction for all 22 included records.
10. First-pass citation hardening completed for key factual sections (intro/background/frameworks/threats/appendices).

## Next Action
Harden the manuscript to peer-review survey standards:
1. Run citation-completeness pass on all factual statements.
2. Validate smolagents/agent API snippets against current official docs.
3. Create submission-ready package (figures, references, appendix artifacts).

## Active Blockers
None.

## Notes for Next Session
1. Primary Track 1 source is now `/Users/quiznat/Desktop/Tree_of_Thought/Tree of Thoughts Meets Hugging Face Agents — ClaudDib.html`.
2. Use `/Users/quiznat/Desktop/Tree_of_Thought/drafts/tot_hf_agents_novel_work_spec.md` as Track 2 source plan.
3. Keep Track 2 in planning mode until benchmark harness starts.
