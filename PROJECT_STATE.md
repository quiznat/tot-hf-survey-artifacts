## Current Focus
Track 1 (Hugging Face blog adaptation from survey draft).

## Current Status
Split architecture completed:
1. Survey draft created.
2. Novel-work research spec created.

## Next Action
Refine the survey draft into a Hugging Face blog-ready post:
1. Set audience and target length.
2. Convert survey structure to blog structure.
3. Validate all API/library claims against current docs.

## Active Blockers
`tot-hf-agents.md` is not present in this workspace; current split used `research_paper_tot_hf_agents.md`.

## Notes for Next Session
1. Use `/Users/quiznat/Desktop/Tree_of_Thought/drafts/tot_hf_agents_survey.md` as Track 1 source draft.
2. Use `/Users/quiznat/Desktop/Tree_of_Thought/drafts/tot_hf_agents_novel_work_spec.md` as Track 2 source plan.
3. Keep Track 2 in planning mode until benchmark harness starts.
