## Current Focus
Track 1 (Hugging Face blog adaptation from survey draft).

## Current Status
Split architecture completed:
1. Survey draft created.
2. Novel-work research spec created.
3. HTML manuscript received a framing/clarity edit pass (survey scope, claim boundaries, pseudo-code labeling, and citation typo fixes).

## Next Action
Refine the HTML manuscript into a Hugging Face blog-ready post:
1. Set audience and target length.
2. Convert survey structure to blog structure while preserving technical depth.
3. Validate all API/library claims against current docs.

## Active Blockers
None.

## Notes for Next Session
1. Primary Track 1 source is now `/Users/quiznat/Desktop/Tree_of_Thought/Tree of Thoughts Meets Hugging Face Agents — ClaudDib.html`.
2. Use `/Users/quiznat/Desktop/Tree_of_Thought/drafts/tot_hf_agents_novel_work_spec.md` as Track 2 source plan.
3. Keep Track 2 in planning mode until benchmark harness starts.
