## Current Focus
Track 1 (scholarly survey publication standard).

## Current Status
Split architecture completed:
1. Survey draft created.
2. Novel-work research spec created.
3. HTML manuscript received a framing/clarity edit pass (survey scope, claim boundaries, pseudo-code labeling, and citation typo fixes).
4. Appendix C rewritten to report source-attributed benchmark evidence only, with explicit evidence boundaries.
5. Unsourced quantitative comparative table removed and replaced with qualitative non-benchmark analysis.

## Next Action
Harden the manuscript to peer-review survey standards:
1. Add explicit survey method section (search strategy, screening, inclusion/exclusion, quality criteria).
2. Build study extraction table and claim-evidence audit log.
3. Run citation-completeness pass on all factual statements.
4. Create submission-ready package (figures, references, appendix artifacts).

## Active Blockers
None.

## Notes for Next Session
1. Primary Track 1 source is now `/Users/quiznat/Desktop/Tree_of_Thought/Tree of Thoughts Meets Hugging Face Agents — ClaudDib.html`.
2. Use `/Users/quiznat/Desktop/Tree_of_Thought/drafts/tot_hf_agents_novel_work_spec.md` as Track 2 source plan.
3. Keep Track 2 in planning mode until benchmark harness starts.
