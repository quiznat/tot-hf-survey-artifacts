## Current Strengths
1. Claim boundaries are explicit.
2. Appendix C now reports source-attributed benchmark data only.
3. Unsourced comparative performance table has been replaced with qualitative analysis.
4. Synthetic case studies are explicitly labeled as non-benchmark examples.

## Gaps To Close For Publication-Grade Survey
1. Missing formal survey method section:
   - No explicit search protocol, query strings, screening process, or date cutoff.
2. Missing study selection transparency:
   - No included/excluded paper flow with reasons.
3. Missing extraction artifact:
   - No structured extraction table linking studies to taxonomy and claims.
4. Partial citation granularity:
   - Many narrative factual claims need inline citation anchors.
5. Missing explicit threats-to-validity section:
   - Needs survey-specific risk analysis (selection bias, benchmark heterogeneity, reporting bias).

## Action Plan (Execution Order)
1. Add Section: "Survey Methodology" (protocol + criteria + dates).
2. Build and insert "Study Selection Flow" table/figure.
3. Build "Study Extraction Matrix" appendix and cite it in synthesis sections.
4. Run sentence-level claim-to-citation audit and patch unresolved claims.
5. Add "Threats to Validity" and tighten conclusion language accordingly.

## Ready-to-Submit Check
- Not ready yet for scholarly survey submission.
- Estimated remaining work: 2-4 focused editing sessions, depending on depth of extraction matrix.
